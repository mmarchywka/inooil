abstract="Doxycycline has been considered the first drug of choice for treating Wolbachia, a member of the Rickettsiaceae, which has a symbiotic relationship with filarial worms, including heartworms. Wolbachia, is susceptible to tetracyclines, which have been used as adjunctive treatments for heartworm disease. Treatment with doxycycline reduces Wolbachia numbers in all stages of heartworms and improves outcomes and decreased microfilaremia in dogs treated for heartworm disease. The American Heartworm Society recommends treatment with doxycycline in dogs diagnosed with heartworm disease at a dose of 10 mg/kg twice daily for 28 days. If doxycycline is not available, minocycline can be considered as a substitute. However, minocycline has not undergone an evaluation in dogs with heartworm disease, nor has an effective dose been established. Minocycline is an attractive option because of the higher cost of doxycycline and new pharmacokinetic information for dogs that provides guidance for appropriate dosage regimens to achieve pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets.",

 abstract = {The interaction between blood-borne pathogens and fibrinolysis is one of the most important mechanisms that mediate invasion and the establishment of infectious agents in their hosts. However, overproduction of plasmin (final product of the route) has been related in other contexts to proliferation and migration of the arterial wall cells and degradation of the extracellular matrix. We have recently identified fibrinolysis-activating antigens from Dirofilaria immitis, a blood-borne parasite whose key pathological event (proliferative endarteritis) is produced by similar mechanisms to those indicated above. The objective of this work is to study how two of this antigens [actin (ACT) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBAL)] highly conserved in pathogens, activate fibrinolysis and to establish a relationship between this activation and the development of proliferative endarteritis during cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis. We demonstrate that both proteins bind plasminogen, enhance plasmin generation, stimulate the expression of the fibrinolytic activators tPA and uPA in endothelial cell cultures and are located on the surface of the worm in contact with the host’s blood. ELISA, western blot and immunofluorescence techniques were employed for this purpose. Additionally, the implication of lysine residues in this interaction was analyzed by bioinformatics. The involvement of plasmin generated by the ACT/FBAL and plasminogen binding in cell proliferation and migration, and degradation of the extracellular matrix were shown in an “in vitro” model of endothelial and smooth muscle cells in culture. The obtained results indicate that ACT and FBAL from D. immitis activate fibrinolysis, which could be used by the parasite like a survival mechanism to avoid the clot formation. However, long-term overproduction of plasmin can trigger pathological events similar to those described in the emergence of proliferative endarteritis. Due to the high degree of evolutionary conservation of these antigens, similar processes may occur in other blood-borne pathogens.},

abstract="Cardiopulmonary nematodes of dogs and cats cause parasitic diseases of central relevance in current veterinary practice. In the recent past the distribution of canine and feline heartworms and lungworms has increased in various geographical areas, including Europe. This is true especially for the metastrongyloids Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Angiostrongylus vasorum and Crenosoma vulpis, the filarioid Dirofilaria immitis and the trichuroid Eucoleus aerophilus (syn. Capillaria aerophila). The reasons of this emergence are little known but many drivers such as global warming, changes in vector epidemiology and movements in animal populations, may be taken into account. The purpose of this article is to review the knowledge of the most important heartworm and lungworm infections of dogs and cats in Europe. In particular recent advances in epidemiology, clinical and control are described and discussed.",

    abstract = { Activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) participate in physiologic thrombolysis. PMN produce large amounts of urokinase (u-PA) and oxidants of the hypochlorite/chloramine-type that generate nonradical excited singlet oxygen (1O2). The u-PA/1O2—mediated thrombolysis was imitated in vitro. One hundred microliters microclots of normal human plasma were oxidized with 25 μL 0 to 5.0 μmoles of chloramine-T in physiol. NaCl in the absence or presence of 100 μL 6\x bovine serum albumin or 100 μL normal plasma. Twenty-five microliters 0 to 167 IU/mL (related to 150 μL added supernatant) u-PA or 0 to 2.08 μg/mL t-PA were added. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined after 0 to 27 hours (37°C). The specific clot turbidity was calculated, subtracting the 100\x lysis absorbance from the respective measured absorbance. The chloramine-effective dose 50\x (ED50) after 27 hours was determined in the presence of 2.6 IU/mL u-PA. The plasminogen activator-ED25 was determined after 2 hours (37°C), and the ET25; i.e., the time needed to lyse a microclot by 25\x, was determined for each respective clot-oxidation. The ED25 of u-PA depends on the oxidation of the microclots: 1.25 μmoles chloramine/100 μL clot enhances thrombolysis approximately 20-fold; here, 25\x of clot lysis is achieved within 50 minutes (using approximately 20 IU/mL u-PA), whereas approximately 5 hours are needed to lyse an unoxidized microclot by 25\x. The present global assay technique imitates the u-PA/1O2 aspects of physiologic thrombolysis by PMN. }

abstract = {Background For treating dogs with heavy heartworm infection, mechanical removal using various retrieval devices is useful. However, the efficacy and safety of retrieval devices have rarely been studied. Hypothesis Catheter-based heartworm removal using 2 retrieval devices (basket and tripod grasping forceps) is efficient and safe for treating dogs with heavy worm burden. Animals Fifty-two client-owned dogs with heavy (Class III and IV) worm burden. Methods A retrospective study was performed on 52 dogs, using a catheter-based heartworm removal approach using 2 types of retrieval devices (ie, the basket and the tripod grasping forceps). The efficacy and complications associated with the 2 devices were assessed. Results The basket device was used on 22 of the study group dogs, and the tripod grasping forceps was used on 30 of the dogs. The postoperative survival rate was 95.5\% for the basket device and 80\% for the tripod grasping forceps, but the difference was not statistically significant. The worm number captured per attempt was 3.5 ± 1.7 using the basket device and 1.9 ± 0.85 for the tripod grasping forceps (P < .05). Various complications associated with heartworm removal were noticed with both retrieval devices. Conclusions and Clinical Importance This study suggests that catheter-based heartworm removal is not only a relatively safe and efficient therapeutic method in dogs with heavy worm burden, but more efficient using the basket device. Our data do not indicate a clear safety advantage between the 2 devices evaluated, although the survival rate was numerically higher in dogs undergoing a basket intervention.},

abstract="In heartworm disease, several biomarkers of cardiopulmonary injury and inflammatory activity have been studied during the recent years. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product present after a clot is degraded, which has been reported to provide support for the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism in heartworm disease. Furthermore, concentrations increment with increased disease severity and during the adulticide treatment. This increase in concentration has proved to be valuable. Cardiac biomarkers troponin I, myoglobin and NT-proBNP demonstrated presence of myocardial injury and heart failure, especially in chronic infections, which in some cases, slightly improve after the adulticide treatment. An acute phase response in dogs with Dirofilaria immitis, characterized by variations of acute phase proteins (APP), has been reported, indicating inflammatory processes that could contribute to disease progression. Among them, C-reactive protein (CRP) increases according to the severity of the disease; and a strong correlation between pulmonary hypertension and CRP has been observed. In cats, little work has been done to ascertain the utility of these biomarkers in feline heartworm; the only published study in D. immitis--seropositive cats reported significantly higher concentrations in positive APP serum amyloid A, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin.",

abstract = {Abstract Wolbachia sp. has colonized over 70\% of insect species, successfully manipulating host fertility, protein expression, lifespan, and metabolism. Understanding and engineering the biochemistry and physiology of Wolbachia holds great promise for insect vector-borne disease eradication. Wolbachia is cultured in cell lines, which have long duplication times and are difficult to manipulate and study. The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 was used successfully as an artificial host for Wolbachia wAlbB. As compared to controls, infected yeast lost viability early, probably as a result of an abnormally high mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity observed at late stages of growth. No respiratory chain proteins from Wolbachia were detected, while several Wolbachia F1F0-ATPase subunits were revealed. After 5 days outside the cell, Wolbachia remained fully infective against insect cells.},

abstract = {Abstract Nematodes are useful organisms for aquatic and soil toxicity testing because of their abundance and diversity as well as their ease of culturing and maintenance in the laboratory. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used extensively in toxicity testing, but its sensitivity to metal exposures in relation to other nematodes remains unclear. In this study, we compare the sensitivity and ease of use of two other rhabditid nematodes, Panagrellus redivivus and Pristionchus pacificus, to C. elegans. Toxicity endpoints were chosen to investigate the effects of Cu on the survival of these nematodes after soil exposures and on the survival, reproduction, movement, and feeding behavior of nematodes after exposures in aquatic medium. In all lethality testing, P. pacificus was the most sensitive, C. elegans exhibited intermediate sensitivity, and P. redivivus was the least sensitive. Reproduction and movement of C. elegans and reproduction of P. pacificus were decreased 50\% by similar concentrations of Cu (EC50s ∼2 mg/L), but P. pacificus movement was less sensitive to Cu exposures (EC50 = 8 mg/L). Although all nematodes may be useful in lethality assays, using P. redivivus in toxicity tests is complicated by the presence of two sexes and difficulties in obtaining age-synchronized cultures. Pristionchus pacificus is an ideal acute toxicity-testing organism because of its sensitivity and ease of culturing. However, C. elegans appears to be more sensitive and therefore most useful in behavioral assays. Future studies of the relative sensitivities of nematodes in toxicity testing should continue to investigate additional toxicants, nematode species, and quantifications of sublethal effects after soil exposures.},

abstract = {Summary Wolbachia pipientis is a widespread intracellular bacterial symbiont of arthropods and is common in insects. One of their more exotic and unexpected hosts is the filarial nematodes, notable for the parasites responsible for onchocerciasis (river blindness), lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and dirofilariasis (heartworm). Wolbachia are only present in a subgroup of the filarial nematodes and do not extend to other groups of nematodes either parasitic or free-living. In the medically and veterinary important species that host Wolbachia, the symbiont has become an essential partner to key biological processes in the life of the nematode to the point where antibiotic elimination of the bacteria leads to a potent and effective anti-filarial drug treatment. We review the cellular and molecular basis of Wolbachia filarial interactions and highlight the key processes provided by the endosymbiont upon which the nematodes have become entirely dependent. This dependency is primarily restricted to periods of the lifecycle with heavy metabolic demands including growth and development of larval stages and embryogenesis in the adult female. Also, the longevity of filarial parasites is compromised following depletion of the symbiont, which for the first time has delivered a safe and effective treatment to kill adult parasites with antibiotics.},

However, such tetracycline-inducible systems carry a risk. Given that mitochondria have a {\textquotedblleft}bacterial{\textquotedblright} ancestry, these antibiotics also target mitochondrial translation and impair mitochondrial function. Indeed, treatment with doxycycline{\textemdash}a tetracycline derivative{\textemdash}disturbs mitochondrial proteostasis and metabolic activity, and induces widespread gene-expression changes. Together, this affects physiology in well-established model systems ranging from cultured cells to simple organisms and to mice and plants. These changes are observed with doxycycline doses that are widely used to regulate gene expression. In light of these findings, and bearing in mind the conserved role of mitochondria in metabolism and whole organism homeostasis, we caution against the use of tetracyclines in experimental approaches. The use of newly developed tetracycline-based systems that are more sensitive could be an alternative; however, even if no overt mitochondrial toxicity is detected, widespread changes in gene expression may sensitize cells to the intended tetracycline-controlled loss or gain of function, thereby introducing a {\textquotedblleft}two-hit model.{\textquotedblright} This is highly relevant for cancer research, as mitochondrial metabolism holds a central position in the reallocation of nutrients for biomass production known as the Warburg effect.

	abstract = {Opsonization by Abs represents a critical component of the host immune response against many pathogens. The mechanisms by which virulent microbes evade this protective response are not completely understood. In disease mediated by Francisella tularensis, Ab can effectively protect against infections with attenuated strains, for example, LVS, but not virulent strains such as SchuS4. Thus, it is likely that SchuS4 has mechanisms, which are not present in LVS, that allow evasion of opsonization by Ab, dampening the protective effects of these host molecules. Here we demonstrate that evasion of Ab-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis by the highly virulent SchuS4 is associated with its ability to bind the host serine protease plasmin. SchuS4, but not the closely related LVS, bound active plasmin. Plasmin bound SchuS4 degraded exogenous and opsonizing Abs, whereas LVS failed to do so. Furthermore, plasmin-mediated inhibition of Ab opsonization by SchuS4 also inhibited Ab-mediated uptake of this bacterium by macrophages. Ab-mediated uptake of uncoated and opsonized SchuS4 elicited a strong proinflammatory response in infected macrophages. However, plasmin-coated, opsonized SchuS4 poorly elicited production of these protective proinflammatory cytokines. This unique host-pathogen interplay is a novel immune evasion strategy utilized by virulent F. tularensis, and it provides one explanation for the ability of Ab to protect against attenuated, but not virulent, strains of F. tularensis. This mechanism may also represent a more common hereto unrecognized strategy by which virulent bacteria evade detection and clearance by Ig.},

All amino acids showed significant response in plant growth characters with corresponding reduction in the number of galls, adult females, egg masses and juvenile stages within the treated plants. DL-phenylalanine gave significantly higher response in reducing the hatch of egg masses and survival of juveniles in in vitro test compared to control. The highest plant growth and maximum reduction of galling incidence of tomato were recorded in the DL-phenylalanine- treated plants followed by L-proline and L-histidine. All the amino acids gave positive response in suppressing the development of the nematode in the treated plants. }

abstract={The in vivo co-administration of ivermectin (IVM) with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) modulator agents has been shown to enhance its systemic availability. However, there is no sufficient evidence on the impact that this type of drug-drug interaction may have on the in vivo efficacy against resistant nematodes in ruminant species. The current work reports on the effects of loperamide (LPM), a P-gp modulating agent, on both IVM kinetic behaviour and anthelmintic activity in infected lambs. Eighteen (18) lambs naturally infected with IVM-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes were allocated into three (3) experimental groups. Group A remained as untreated control. Animals in Groups B and C received IVM (200μg/kg, subcutaneously) either alone or co-administered with LPM (0.2 mg/kg, twice every 12h), respectively. Individual faecal samples were collected from experimental animals at days −1 and 14 post-treatment to perform the faecal eggs count reduction test (FECRT). Blood samples were collected between 0 and 14 days post-treatment and IVM plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC. Additionally, at day 14 post-treatment, lambs from all experimental groups were sacrificed and adult gastrointestinal nematode counts were performed. FECRT values increased from 78.6 (IVM alone) to 96% (IVM+LPM). Haemonchus contortus was highly resistant to IVM. The IVM alone treatment was completely ineffective (0% efficacy) against adult H. contortus. This efficacy value increased up to 72.5% in the presence of LPM. The efficacy against Trichostrongylus colubriformis increased from 77.9% (IVM alone) to 96.3% (IVM+LPM). The described favorable tendency towards improved anthelmintic efficacy was in agreement with the enhanced IVM plasma availability (P <0.05) and prolonged elimination half-life (P <0.05) induced by LPM in infected lambs. A LPM-induced P-gp modulation increases IVM systemic exposure in the host but also it may reduce P-gp efflux transport over-expressed in target resistant nematodes.}

	abstract = {Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic used in filariasis control programs. By binding to nematode glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls), IVM disrupts neurotransmission processes regulated by GluCl activity. IVM treatment of filarial infections is characterized by an initial dramatic drop in the levels of circulating microfilariae, followed by long-term suppression of their production, but the drug has little direct effect on microfilariae in culture at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. We localized Brugia malayi GluCl expression solely in a muscle structure that surrounds the microfilarial excretory-secretory (ES) vesicle, which suggests that protein release from the ES vesicle is regulated by GluCl activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, exposure to IVM in vitro decreased the amount of protein released from microfilariae. To better understand the scope of IVM effects on protein release by the parasite, three different expression patterns were identified from immunolocalization assays on a representative group of five microfilarial ES products. Patterns of expression suggest that the ES apparatus is the main source of regulated ES product release from microfilariae, as it is the only compartment that appears to be under neuromuscular control. Our results show that IVM treatment of microfilariae results in a marked reduction of protein release from the ES apparatus. Under in vivo conditions, the rapid microfilarial clearance induced by IVM treatment is proposed to result from suppression of the ability of the parasite to secrete proteins that enable evasion of the host immune system.},

abstract = {Summary Lactococcus lactis is a fermenting Gram-positive bacterium widely used for production of dairy products. Lacking haem biosynthesis genes, L. lactis can still shift to an energetically favourable respiratory metabolism by activating a terminal cytochrome bd oxidase when haem is added to an aerated culture. Haem intracellular homeostasis is mediated by the hrtRBA operon encoding the conserved membrane HrtBA haem efflux permease and the unique intracellular haem sensor and regulator, HrtR. Here we report that membrane-associated menaquinones (MK) favour the accumulation of reduced haem in membranes. An oxidative environment, provided by oxygen, prevents and reverses haemin reduction by MK and thus limits haem accumulation in membranes. HrtBA counteracts MK-dependent membrane retention of excess haem in membrane, suggesting direct efflux from this compartment. Moreover, both HrtBA and MK-mediated reduction have a strong impact on haem intracellular pools, as determined via HrtR haem sensor induction, suggesting that intracellular haem acquisition is controlled at the membrane level without the need for dedicated import systems. Our conclusions lead to a new hypothesis of haem acquisition and regulation in which HrtBA and the bacterial membrane have central roles in L. lactis.},

abstract="Heavy metal toxicity to an indigenous nematode community was examined following the addition of Cu and Zn, alone or in combination, to agricultural soil. The dissolved Cu or Zn concentrations measured after equilibrating soil samples with a 0.01 M solution of CaCl2 showed that the metal concentrations found in soils with combined metal additions were not significantly different from those with single metal additions. After an exposure period of six months, many nematode community parameters and individual nematode taxa were significantly affected by increasing concentrations of Cu and Zn up to 200 mg kg−1. Some nematode taxa, such as Thonus, Alaimus and Aporcelaimellus were very sensitive and disappeared at Cu and Zn concentrations exceeding 50 mg kg−1. For several nematode community parameters and nematode taxa, EC50 values for single metal exposures were used to calculate TU50 values for the joint toxicity of Cu and Zn. Based on these calculations, it is concluded that the effects of a combined exposure to Cu and Zn were additive or less than additive. Before this conclusion can be generalised, however, more data are needed on other types of soil, other pH values and other combinations of pollutants.",

 abstract = {Proteases were detected in aqueous extracts of Dirofilaria immitis microfilariae. Enzymes within the extract were capable of hydrolyzing Azocoll, a general protease substrate, at pH's 7, 8, and 9. Sensitivities to a variety of protease inhibitors indicated that multiple azocollytic enzymes were present in the extract, most prominent of which appear to belong to the serine class of proteases. By incorporating various substrates into the matrices of polyacrylamide gels, 2 SDS-resistant, mercaptoethanol-sensitive proteases in the MF extract were identified at 22 and 76 kDa. These proteases showed differential abilities to digest casein, fibrinogen, hemoglobin, and IgG. The MF extract hydrolyzed radiolabeled IgG into 8-10-kDa fragments following a 20-hr incubation. A similar degree of digestion was observed in 2 hr when viable microfilariae were used. The potential significance of these proteases in the evasion of host effector mechanisms is discussed.},

 abstract = {Author Summary The human filarial parasite Brugia malayi harbors a Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacterium that is required for normal reproduction and development. However, the molecular basis of how this essential endosymbiotic relationship is maintained is not understood. As a first step in trying to understand the molecular interactions that might be essential in this process, we focused on the Wolbachia surface proteins (WSPs), which are known to be involved in bacteria-host interactions in other systems. Our aim was to determine whether there are any functional interactions between some of these WSPs and the proteins produced by the host parasite cells. We found that two of the WSP family members specifically interact with proteins produced by the host. Wolbachia wBm0432 interacted with several key enzymes involved in the host glycolytic pathway, the primary energy-producing pathway in the cell. Wolbachia wBm0152 interacted with the host cytoskeleton. These findings suggest that WSP family proteins might play important roles in both optimization of the energy production pathway in B. malayi as well as in anchoring the endosymbiont to the host's cytoskeleton.},

Due to this primary mechanism of transmission, most studies have focused on Wolbachia interactions with the host germline. However, over the last decade many studies have emerged highlighting the prominence of Wolbachia in somatic tissues, implicating somatic tissue tropism as an important aspect of the life history of this endosymbiont. Here, we review our current understanding of Wolbachia–host interactions at both the cellular and organismal level, with a focus on Wolbachia in somatic tissues.},

However, little is known about mechanisms of early local events in filarial infections. In this study, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells not only upregulated activation markers CD40 and CD80 upon in vitro stimulation with filarial extracts, but also secreted CCL17, a chemokine known to be produced upon microbial challenge. Mice deficient for CCL17 had an up to 4-fold higher worm burden compared with controls by day 10 of infection with the murine filaria Litomosoides sigmodontis. Also, numbers of mast cells (MCs) invading the skin and degranulation were significantly increased, which was associated with enhanced vascular permeability and larval establishment. This phenotype was reverted by inhibition of MC degranulation with disodium cromoglycate or by blockade of histamine. In addition, we showed that CCL17-mediated vascular permeability was dependent on the presence of Wolbachia endosymbionts and TLR2. Our findings reveal that CCL17 controls filarial larval entry by limiting MC-dependent vascular permeability.},

abstract ={Aberrant Zn2+ homeostasis is a hallmark of certain cardiomyopathies associated with altered contractile force. In this study, we addressed whether Zn2+ modulates cardiac ryanodine receptor gating and Ca2+ dynamics in isolated cardiomyocytes. We reveal that Zn2+ is a high affinity regulator of RyR2 displaying three modes of operation. Picomolar free Zn2+ concentrations potentiate RyR2 responses, but channel activation is still dependent on the presence of cytosolic Ca2+. At concentrations of free Zn2+ >1 nm, Zn2+ is the main activating ligand, and the dependence on Ca2+ is removed. Zn2+ is therefore a higher affinity activator of RyR2 than Ca2+. Millimolar levels of free Zn2+ were found to inhibit channel openings. In cardiomyocytes, consistent with our single channel results, we show that Zn2+ modulates both the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ waves in a concentration-dependent manner and that physiological levels of Zn2+ elicit Ca2+ release in the absence of activating levels of cytosolic Ca2+. This highlights a new role for intracellular Zn2+ in shaping Ca2+ dynamics in cardiomyocytes through modulation of RyR2 gating.},

abstract ={The trace element copper is indispensable for all aerobic life forms. Its ability to cycle between two oxidation states, Cu1+ and Cu2+, has been harnessed by a wide array of metalloenzymes that catalyze electron transfer reactions. The metabolic needs for copper are sustained by a complex series of transporters and carrier proteins that regulate its intracellular accumulation and distribution in both pathogenic microbes and their animal hosts. However, copper is also potentially toxic due in part to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Recent studies suggest that the macrophage phagosome accumulates copper during bacterial infection, which may constitute an important mechanism of killing. Bacterial countermeasures include the up-regulation of copper export and detoxification genes during infection, which studies suggest are important determinants of virulence. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments that suggest an emerging role for copper as an unexpected component in determining the outcome of host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract={Metal limitation is a common situation during infection and can have profound effects on the pathogen’s success. In this report, we examine the role of zinc limitation in the expression of a virulence factor in uropathogenic Escherichia coli. The pyelonephritis isolate J96 carries two hlyCABD operons that encode the RTX toxin α-hemolysin. While the coding regions of both operons are largely conserved, the upstream sequences, including the promoters, are unrelated. We show here that the two hlyCABD operons are differently regulated. The hlyIIoperon is efficiently silenced in the presence of zinc and highly expressed when zinc is limited. In contrast, the hlyIoperon does not respond to zinc limitation. Genetic studies reveal that zinc-responsive regulation of the hlyIIoperon is controlled by the Zur metalloregulatory protein. A Zur binding site was identified in the promoter sequence of the hlyIIoperon, and we observe direct binding of Zur to this promoter region. Moreover, we find that Zur regulation of the hlyIIoperon modulates the ability of E. coli J96 to induce a cytotoxic response in host cell lines in culture. Our report constitutes the first description of the involvement of the zinc-sensing protein Zur in directly modulating the expression of a virulence factor in bacteria.},

	abstract = {One form of immune evasion is a developmental state called {\textquotedblleft}persistence{\textquotedblright} whereby chlamydial pathogens respond to the host-mediated withdrawal of l-tryptophan (Trp). A sophisticated survival mode of reversible quiescence is implemented. A mechanism has evolved which suppresses gene products necessary for rapid pathogen proliferation but allows expression of gene products that underlie the morphological and developmental characteristics of persistence. This switch from one translational profile to an alternative translational profile of newly synthesized proteins is proposed to be accomplished by maximizing the Trp content of some proteins needed for rapid proliferation (e.g., ADP/ATP translocase, hexose-phosphate transporter, phosphoenolpyruvate [PEP] carboxykinase, the Trp transporter, the Pmp protein superfamily for cell adhesion and antigenic variation, and components of the cell division pathway) while minimizing the Trp content of other proteins supporting the state of persistence. The Trp starvation mechanism is best understood in the human-Chlamydia trachomatis relationship, but the similarity of up-Trp and down-Trp proteomic profiles in all of the pathogenic Chlamydiaceae suggests that Trp availability is an underlying cue relied upon by this family of pathogens to trigger developmental transitions. The biochemically expensive pathogen strategy of selectively increased Trp usage to guide the translational profile can be leveraged significantly with minimal overall Trp usage by (i) regional concentration of Trp residue placements, (ii) amplified Trp content of a single protein that is required for expression or maturation of multiple proteins with low Trp content, and (iii) Achilles{\textquoteright}-heel vulnerabilities of complex pathways to high Trp content of one or a few enzymes.},

TLR9 ligand–induced pulmonary IDO activity inhibits Th2-driven experimental asthma. IDO activity expressed by resident lung cells rather than by pulmonary DCs suppressed lung inflammation and airway hyperreactivity.

abstract = {A possible role for C1q in antibody-dependent granulocyte-mediated killing of nonphagocytosable targets was investigated utilizing IgG-dependent granulocyte cytotoxicity directed against microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis. Granulocyte-mediated killing of microfilariae is enhanced by addition of fresh serum. Lack of C4 did not significantly reduce the observed increase in cytotoxicity. The addition of highly purified monomeric human Clq (0.2 microgram/ml) in the presence of immune IgG resulted in a two- to fivefold enhancement of killing (P less than 0.025). C1q enhancement of killing occurred in the absence of fluid-phase IgG, but killing was significantly less than when both fluid-phase IgG and C1q were present. The effect of C1q was inhibited by the addition of solubilized type I collagen (44-92% inhibition of killing, P less than 0.05). Significant 125I-Clq binding to microfilariae occurred only in the presence of immune IgG. In addition, C1q in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml resulted in a dose-dependent increase in binding of 125I-immune IgG to microfilariae. Finally, when purified C1q was added to preopsonized, washed microfilariae, granulocyte production of superoxide was increased from 0.25 +/- 0.07 to 0.68 +/- 0.07 nm/10(6) cells.10 min (P less than 0.01). These results describe a novel functional role for C1q in enhancement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity towards nonphagocytosable targets.},

 abstract = {Author Summary Trichinellosis is one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses worldwide. The key factor for Trichinella spiralis to survive in its host is evading from the attacks by the immune defense system. Our previous study revealed that paramyosin from Trichinella spiralis (Ts-Pmy) played a role in evading host immune attacks by binding to human complement C8 and C9. Here, we demonstrated that Ts-Pmy inhibited classical complement activation by binding to human complement C1q. As a result, classical complement pathway-mediated hemolysis was inhibited in the presence of Ts-Pmy. Additionally, Ts-Pmy inhibited C1q binding to THP-1-derived macrophages and C1q-induced macrophages migration. These results suggest that Trichinella spiralis paramyosin is a potential immunomodulator involved in the evasion of the host complement attack by binding to C1q in addition to C8/C9, and therefore is a potent vaccine target against trichinellosis.},

By mating these mice with albumin-Cre mice, we generated Ggcx-deficient mice specifically in hepatocytes (GgcxΔliver/Δliver mice). In contrast to conventional Ggcx knockout mice, GgcxΔliver/Δliver mice had very low activity of Ggcx in the liver and survived several weeks after birth. Furthermore, compared with heterozygous mice (Ggcx+/Δliver), GgcxΔliver/Δliver mice had shorter life spans. GgcxΔliver/Δliver mice displayed bleeding diathesis, which was accompanied by decreased activity of coagulation factors II and IX. Ggcx-floxed mice can prove useful in examining Ggcx functions in vivo.},

Host innate immunity modulated by metabolites has been proved as a powerful strategy against bacterial infections. However, few studies focus on the application of this strategy against S. aureus infection. Here, we identified four metabolite biomarkers, L-proline, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, and L-valine (PILV), by a metabolomics study. In animal models of S. aureus bloodstream infection, exogenous administration of each metabolite or PILV shows an anti-infective effect, while PILV treatment has higher protection than individual metabolite treatment. Each metabolite targets nitric oxide (NO) to kill S. aureus via arginase inhibition, and PILV exhibits additive inhibition of arginase activity that causes further killing. This suppression also contributes to the metabolite-mediated phagocytic killing of S. aureus in human blood. Our finding demonstrates the metabolite-mediated innate immunity as a therapeutic intervention for S. aureus infection.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACTIntroduction: There is an ongoing need for additional interventions in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as antifibrotic drugs currently available only inhibit and do not stall disease progression. Vitamin K is a co-factor for the activation of coagulation factors. However, it is also required to activate proteins with functions outside of the coagulation cascade, such as matrix Gla protein (MGP), a defender against soft tissue calcification. Vitamin K antagonists are anticoagulants that are, for unknown reasons, associated with increased mortality in IPF.Areas covered: We advance the hypothesis that modulation of vitamin K-dependent MGP activation in IPF patients by either vitamin K antagonism or administration may result in acceleration and deceleration of fibrosis progression, respectively. Furthermore, shortfall in vitamin K could be suspected in IPF based on the high prevalence of certain co-morbidities, such as vascular calcification and lung cancer.Expert commentary: We hypothesize that vitamin K status is reduced in IPF patients. This, in combination with studies suggesting that vitamin K may play a role in lung fibrosis pathogenesis, would provide a rationale for conducting a clinical trial assessing the potential mitigating effects of vitamin K administration on progression of lung fibrosis, prevention of co-morbidities and mortality in IPF. }

In vitro model systems were used to assess coagulation dynamics at pH 7.4 and 7.0. Clot formation dynamics are slightly enhanced at pH 7.0 in blood ex vivo. Acidosis induced decreases in antithrombin efficacy offset impairments in procoagulant activity. Summary Background Disruption of hydrogen ion homeostasis is a consequence of traumatic injury often associated with clinical coagulopathy. Mechanisms by which acidification of the blood leads to aberrant coagulation require further elucidation. Objective To examine the effects of acidified conditions on coagulation dynamics using in vitro models of increasing complexity. Methods Coagulation dynamics were assessed at pH 7.4 and 7.0 as follows: (i) tissue factor (TF)-initiated coagulation proteome mixtures (factor [F]XI, fibrinogen/FXIII), with reaction progress monitored as thrombin generation or fibrin formation; (ii) enzyme/inhibitor reactions; and (iii) TF-dependent or independent clot dynamics in contact pathway-inhibited blood via viscoelastometry. Results Rate constants for antithrombin inhibition of FXa and thrombin were reduced by ~ 2530\% at pH 7.0. At pH 7.0 (+FXI), TF-initiated thrombin generation showed a 20\% increase in maximum thrombin levels and diminished thrombin clearance rates. Viscoelastic analyses showed a 25\% increase in clot time and a 25\% reduction in maximum clot firmness (MCF). A similar MCF reduction was observed at pH 7.0 when fibrinogen/FXIII were reacted with thrombin. In contrast, in contact pathway-inhibited blood (n = 6) at pH 7.0, MCF values were elevated 6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1\%11\%) in TF-initiated blood and 15\% (95\% CI: 1\% 29\%) in the absence of TF. Clot times at pH 7.0 decreased 32\% (95\% CI: 15\%49\%) in TF-initiated blood and 51\% (95\% CI: 35\%68\%) in the absence of TF. Conclusions Despite reported decreased procoagulant catalysis at pH 7.0, clot formation dynamics are slightly enhanced in blood ex vivo and suppression of thrombin generation is not observed. A decrease in antithrombin reactivity is one potential mechanism contributing to these outcomes.},

@article{PMC5922700,
abstract = {Thrombosis is a complication of many chronic illnesses. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus are common medical conditions frequently associated with a hypercoagulable state. Acidaemia has been shown to reduce coagulation. COPD and diabetes mellitus during acute deterioration can present with a severe acidaemia. The impact of this acidaemia on coagulation is poorly studied. Patients presenting with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis or  type II respiratory failure from COPD and a pH of less than 7.2 were included in  our study. A coagulation screen and a thromboelastograph (TEG) were performed on  admission and 24 hours later. The mean pH on admission was 7.07 and mean base excess was 16.3. The activated partial thromboplastin time was associated with pH change but remained within the normal range (2641 s). All other coagulation and TEG parameters failed to show evidence of association (p>0.05). In the two models of non-haemorrhagic acidosis investigated, coagulation was not altered by  the changes in pH. More work is needed to understand the complex relationship between factors affecting coagulation in individual disease processes.},
