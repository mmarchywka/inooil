\section{About the Authors and Facility}
This work was performed at a dog rescue run by Barbara Cade and
housed in rural Georgia.  The author of this report
,Mike Marchywka,
has a background in electrical engineering and
has done extensive research using free online literature sources.
I hope to find additional people interested in critically
examining the results and verify that they can be reproduced
effectively to treat other dogs.

Supporting files. Note that some dates,sizes, and md5's will change as this is
rebuilt.

This really needs to include the data analysis code
but right now it is auto generated picking up things from prior
build in many cases
