\begin{abstract}
A recent report manuscript \cite{marchywka-MJM-2024-010-0.01rg}
described results of feeding a set of supplements to dogs with
a particular concern for copper. One objective of that work
was to return a dog with heart condition, Happy, back to a
high-energy state free from coughing as she briefly obtained
in early 2019. This was not achieved so a closer look at the 2019
diet pointed to other possible contributors that had been neglected
recently. These included extra virgin olive oil(EVOO) , inositol, PABA,
and silicon dioxide. Adding these components did appear to help
Happy regain energy and add to feeding eagness by 2 of the other
dogs. There is some indication Happy is coughing less now primarily
thought to be due to the EVOO and inositol.

\section{Introduction  }

A previous recent report detailed the overall safety and
possible benefits of copper supplemetation in a group of dogs
with heart benefits thought to be the most relevant
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2024-010-0.01rg} .
However, results were not entirely successful particularly in the
case of Happy who never achieved "cough free" status as
she had briefly in early 2019. Further lack of progress
motivated a more detailed
examination of the last known working diet which revealed
likely contributors to overall health. 
Two differences were found that were may have been important.
First, the extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO or simply olive oil herein)
had been mostly eliminated except as an undisclosed liquid
to distribute vitamin D supplements. Seconldy, the
earlier diet had used a multi-B vitamin known more or less
as Big-B or B-100 or GNC-100 \cite{250Caplets250Servings_100_Complex_}.
Most of the active ingredients from the label, pictured in \mjmreffig{gnclab},
had been replace by pure versions except for choline, inositol,
and PABA. None of the "Other" ingredients had been intentionally
replaced although some appear in other vitamin formulations.

\mjmpicture{nc100_label.png}{ Label from a recent version of the product similar to original. The mcg units on inositol is thought to be a mistake although no attempt was made to investigate. }{gnclab}

This work describes the results of adding back these neglected components.
While the diet has only been in use for a little over a month
with interuption, eating eagnerness has improved with overall energy
level. Only three of the dogs were notably "off" but none in
particularly bad shape. Dexter had initially been a picky
eater but much better with zinc now more consistent and eager.
Rocky too would often prefer to sleep through breakfast now 
rungs to it even when cold. Happy however may be getting some
cough reduction with more youthful energy level.  
2 of the dogs, Annie and Trixie,  have died since the last report
and prior to significant consumption of these new components. 

\section{ Discovery and Consideration of Suspects }

An inability to entirely return Happy to her high-energy cough-free
state motivated a more careful examination of the last known working
diet from early 2019. The two most obvious suspects were extra
virgin olive oil (EVOO ) and ignored components of the GNC B-100
supplement. The latter containing all of those considere below except
the EVOO, see the picture\mjmreffig{gnclab}.

\subsection{Extra Virgin Olive Oil }

Olive oil is a complex natural product and a perennial suspect 
for healthy diets with many questions and paradoxes
\cite{10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00545-4} . 
A lot of motivation for study comes from its inclusion in the
Mediterranean Diet and its complex composition 
\cite{Silva_RodriguezPerez_BurgosRamos_Zebrafish_Model_Insights_into_2023}.
\mjmtol{ the above claims to look at liquids in Med Diet but fails to 
mention vinegar, just EVOO and wine ... } 
Currently most health benefits are thought to relate to
the monounsaturated oleic acid which is the majority 
of extra virgin olive oil although many other components
are potentially active such as polyphenols and
hydroxytyrosol  \cite{LU2024529}
\cite{Milena_Maurizio_Exploring_Cardiovascular_Benefits_2025}
.
While oleic acid is itself a fatty acid, it may paradoxically  
act to minimize
pathological fat accumulation or facilitate lipid homeostasis.
In a small lab study in rats, it was concluded that, 
" [...]  the intake of dietary high OA [ oleic acid ]  may enhance 
the omega‐3 fatty acid levels in the blood plasma of rats and 
may have a positive effect in reducing risks to cardiovascular disease, 
as evidenced by weight loss, increased HDL‐C levels, and decreased 
TG levels in the blood plasma of experimental animals" \cite{PMC7382191}.
Lipid homeostasis and  possible health and longevity improvements may be
achieved through endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear mechanisms
\cite{CastilloQuan_Steinbaugh_FernandezCardenas_antisteatosis_response_regulated_2023} 
.
It may also act to improve skeletal muscle cell phenotype.
Mice supplemented with oleic acid for 4 weeks had improved endurance
and benficial changes in skeletal muscle fibre composition 
over those supplemented with palmitic acid 
\cite{Komiya_Iseki_Ochiai_Dietary_oleic_acid_intake_2024}.
Its tempting to consider the possibility of similar benefits
to heart muscle. 
Oleic acid can reduce some problems like hepatic insulin resistance
from a palmitic acid diet \cite{10.1016/j.gpb.2019.06.005}.


In addition to these well considered functions, it could also act
as a simple yet unique solventt although no direct evidence is available. 
Interestingly, it is observed that copper can form copper oleate
which can diffuse through oil 
\cite{Liang_Wang_Zhong_Investigation_Into_Formation_2024}
but its not clear how this varies among other fatty acids or biological
molecules. Some works have looked at copper compounds but produced
with synthetic means such as electrochemistry
\cite{CostaCarvalho_Copper_Organic_Complexes_Synthetized_2022}.
( Oleic acid is also the material of choice in particle formation
via electric discharge \cite{Khilji_BintiMohdSafee_Pathak_Facile_Manufacture_Oxide_2022} but again hard to get context and relevant to biological systems.)
A copper compound highly diffusible in lipids may have significant impact
on copper distribution.  The biological implications are not clear
as no literature was found that addresses the topic directly. 

It may have some specific attributes as a fuel although little
information currently exists. 
Saturated and monounsaturated fats appear to be prefered by astrocytes
for B-oxidation although some confusion remains about the preference
for oleic or palmitic acid \cite{https://doi.org/10.1111/gtc.13144}.



\subsection{inositol}

Inositol literature was also highly suggestive of a wide range of
benefits but no compelling evidence exists of specific efficacy
and endogenous production is often considere sufficient.
A 2016 report found that inositol was likely safe for
dogs and cat but lacking any benefit
\cite{https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4511}.
While inositol is synthesized the overall regulation of synthesis,
uptake, and elimination is not well uderstood
\cite{Su_Ko_Saiardi_Regulations_inositol_2023}.
Inositol and derivatives are widely distributed in plant and
animal cells and therefore exist in most diets but
may be difficult to absorb but the kidneys make several grams
per day in humans \cite{PMC7554709} without dietary inputs.

Inositol phosphates form a family of  signalling
molecules 
\cite{LOURDES2024101001}
, including pyphosphates
\cite{Szijgyarto_Garedew_Azevedo_Influence_Inositol_Pyrophosphates_2011},
which seem to be common in eukaryotic cells
\cite{Laha_PortelaTorres_Desfougeres_Inositol_phosphate_kinases_2021}
.
Carefully regulated inositol derivatives are needed for
proper development of Drosophila melanogaster \cite{PMC8565467}
and an inositol hexaphosphate kinase may have an effect on
lifespan in mice \cite{Moritoh_Oka_Yasuhara_Inositol_Hexakisphosphate_Kinase_2016}.


It is  important to note that high inositol has been
associated with both heart and kidney pathology suggesting
it has a pathological role \cite{Pouleur_Menghoum_Cumps_Plasma_inositol_elevation_2024} 
and " stimulates the transcription of genes underlying hypertrophic growth."
\cite{Demydenko_EkhteraeiTousi_Roderick_Inositol_2022}.
But many results show beneficial effects of exogenous
inositol or phosphate derivatives.
One recent review considers heart and brain disease, diabetes, 
cancer and reproductive health \cite{Chhetri_Inositol_2019}.
Some reports of heart benefits   include
moderation of pathological effects of high fat diet
on heart including improved rhythm and reduced remodeling
\cite{LABBATE2020105047}
or indirectly by improved oxygen delivery from hemoglobin
\cite{Biolo_Greferath_Siwik_Enhanced_exercise_capacity_2009}
. 
It is thought to be useful for managing PCOS due to insulin signalling
roles but clinical data are inconclusive
\cite{10.1210/clinem/dgad762}.
Added myo-inositol improved results, at least in part due
to improved mitochondria performance,  when added
 during in vitro culture of porcine embryoes 
\cite{Jawad_Oh_Choi_inositol_improves_developmental_2024}.
Interestingly inositol appears to be important for mitochondia
performance. Energy production was on central concern for
Happy and her copper supplementation. 
Inositol inhibits mitochondrial fission apparently due to the
inositol sensing effects of AMPK \cite{PMC8462099}.
Signalling my inositol phosphates is an integral part of mitochondria
Ca regulation 
\cite{Gilabert_Energized_mitochondria_increase_2001}
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1113/JP288022}
Other  benefits exist for conditions such as 
diabetic nephropathy
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.23032}
and cisplatin exposure \cite{Xie_Wang_Li_Role_inositol_2023}
\cite{Qi_Deng_Wang_Inositol_Supplementation_Alleviates_2023} 
It may also have a role to play in thyroid health especially in 
cases of boarderline low hormone output 
\cite{PMC8143049} as has been suspected previously to be a common
problem in dogs. 

\mjmtolx{ 
Its also interesting to note that there is a known
variant of an inositol related receptor of significance  (
ITPR1 GOF variant W1457G ) 
\cite{doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.070563}
involving the loss of tryptophan which could also occur to some
extent due to high infidelity translation in the presence of
tryptophan deficiency although "mutation" to other amino acids
may be more likey than G.  As this is a GoF it may be quite sensitive
to the new acid.  }


Inositol and derivatives may mitigate  various stresses in a range
of organisms such as salt stress in the plant Tamarix ramosissima
\cite{Li_Fan_Zhang_Effects_Inositol_2023}
and acute ammonia toxicity in fish 
\cite{Wang_Meng_Liu_Exogenous_inositol_ameliorates_2021}.

Inotitol's interaction with lithium may be of passing
relevance in  most people and animals but it may illustrate
some common limitations of designing interventions from 
incomplete pathways. 
First, it has been observed to reduce effects of toxic lithium dosing
in several measures of heart quatlity \cite{LABBATE2024117287}.
But perhaps more interestingly, 
lithium has recently been considered in Alzheimer's Disease 
due to lower amounts in the diseased state and 
the benefits of supplementation \cite{PMC12443616}. 
General effects of lithium on the brain have been explored
for some time and it was suggested in 2013 and 2014 that the 
effects of lithium may be due to
modulation of inositol signalling 
\cite{Toker_Bersudsky_Plaschkes_Inositol_Related_Gene_Knockouts_2014}
\cite{doi:10.1021/cn5001149} suggesting that the inositol system  
is a better point of intervention if it can be done more
directly. 
It is easy to find reasons why Li may be depleted in old age such
as reduced stomach acid which may reduce absorption of many metals. 
Suppplementation may coincidentally modulate a related
pathway as lithium appears to do in the case of inositol but it
does fix the actual problem ( if there is an inositol defect )
 and therefore is likely to have limited
clinical benefit. Although it may be quite useful up to a point
 it is also misleading and ultimately a dead end for a cure. 
Generally nutrient deficincies are expected 
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2023-008-0.30rg}
and inositol or a related
supplement may be worth investigation for this condition. 
This set of observations gets back to the important role of understanding
cause and effect in designing an intervention but recognizing 
complete pathways are not known and a lot of guessing may be the most
scitnfic thing to do.  


\subsection{PABA}

PABA is probably one of the more controversial components.
It has been described as "vitamin like" in a report suggesting
imrpovement in tumor radiosensitivity related to phenotype changes
including reduced melanogeneesis \cite{XAVIER2006517}.
It is a similar to sodium  benzoate which had previously
been used due to a
variety of speculative considerations from thyroid to dental to
microbial health 
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2024-010-0.01rg}
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2022-013-0.10}
.
PABA however may have coontrasting microbial and thyroid effects.
It seems to have no value to the mouse but doe create susceptibility
to the parasite  Plasmodium berghei \cite{JACOBS1964213}
although it is also claimed to be anti-viral \cite{Akberova2002}.
When combined with a  tumor inducer, PABA at .5 percent of diet
increased incidence of thyroid tumors and increased TSH 
and proliferation alone \cite{PMID15843508}. Its not clear
however if these changes are pathological although suggestive
of a route to cancer or other diseases. 
A few years later, in 1948, hypothyroid conditions induced by
PABA or other means showed interactions between choline deficiency
and liver pathology \cite{HANDLER1948669}. That work is somewhat
similar to the present work except that more pathways have been
ceteched out and, "we've got computers"  allowing for many possible
deficiencies to be remediated in a tractable way. 

It appears to modulate neurotransmitter levels
with recently described anti-cholinesterase activity 
\cite{PMC10604881}
and enhancement  tryptophan hydroxylase activity among
\cite{Chen_Su_Wu_Molecular_mechanisms_therapeutic_2025}.
It is used controversially in Peyronie's disease where it is thought to
improve oxygenation and decrease fibrosis 
although side effects such as hepatitis are a concern \cite{ROY20082967}.
\mjmtol{ remember Sildenafil and heart? lol }
In 1945 it was observed to improve resistance to decreased barometric
pressure \cite{10.1210/endo-37-4-223}.



\subsection{choline}

 Choline is not considered
a likely suspect due to the egg and lecithin content of the background
diet but could not be ruled out. 
Some experiments have suggested a non-monotonic relationship
to heart failure with both high and low intake being deleterious
 but mediated by a metabolite, TMAO, in the high side \cite{PMC7793226}.
Similar results were shown for ASCVD
\cite{Lin_Zhong_Zhang_inverse_association_2024} but
association studies of this type can easily be misleading as
colinearlity with other food components could modulate apparent
response to "choline" intake. 
Another work showed an L shaped association between choline intake
and stroke risk saturating around 276mg/day
\cite{Wang_Lin_Fan_Choline_consumption_reduces_2024}.
Choline supplements may reduce the severity of Alzheimer's Disease
\cite{PMC6826123}.
Lack of choline in parenteral feeding appears to create liver
steatosis which can be prevented with supplementation 
\cite{Sheard_Tayek_Bistrian_Plasma_choline_concentration_1986}.
Choline is essential for dogs and commercial foods are supplemented
from sources such as choline chloride \cite{PMC9558542}.
Choline bitartate has recently been associated with stones in dogs
\cite{PMC12035869}
and so an althernatve, CDP choline was used.
This has been used in various experiments with dogs
\cite{PMC9151482} \cite{PMID34715589} with 
no obvious acute issues. 


\subsection{Silica }

Additional suspects included silicon dioxide. The biology of silicon
is not well known and generally "sand" is considered inert.
Silicon appears to have been well established as a nutrient
with a structural or metabolic role or both
and is beneficial for many conditions 
\cite{Carlisle_Silicon_Essential_2007}
\cite{Martin2013}
\cite{CARLISLE198895}.
Consumption of soluble silicon may improve age related conditions
such as atherosclerosis 
\cite{vv321ukaszDudek_vv322awKochman_Dziedzic_Silicon_prevention_2024}
although  evidence is inconclusive. 
Very recently a silicate based therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy
was investigated 
\cite{Sun_Zhang_Gao_Silicate_based_therapy_2025}.

Candidates for supplementation include silicon dioxide and sodium
metasilicate both or which are readily available. The metasilicate
is fairly soluble but corrosive and concerns about safety of side
reactions argued against its use. 
Finally, a food grade anti-caking  sio2 source was purchased 
\cite{DUM_Amazon_Silicon_Dioxide_} although
adding to dog diets was delayed.
Silica appears in the Carlson copper supplement and possibly others.
Many sources have been discussed in the literature along with
suggested dosing. 
Interestinghly, alcohol free beer absorption was quite high 
and as expected absorption from colloidal silia rather low
in one small test
\cite{Sripanyakorn_Jugdaohsingh_Dissayabutr_comparative_absorption_2009}.
In a work exploring collagen and proteoglycan silicon, it was suggested
that about 25mg of silicon/day is beneficial and orthosilicic acid
as possible supplement source 
\cite{doi:10.1177/1535370221997072}.
Another work recommended similar intake amount from grains and vegetables
and beverages made from grains
\cite{NIELSEN2014379}.
Doses as high as 20mg/kg/day have been explored in postmenopausal animals
and desmonstrated increased bone mineral density
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/316783}.
Synthetic silicon delivery molecules such as 
"monomethylsilanetriol, a monomeric, organosilicon molecule $[Si(OH)_3CH_3] $
have been designed around the details of the GI tract 
\cite{Scholey_Belton_Burton_Bioavailability_novel_2018}

Silicon chemistry is probably best known from integrated circuit processing.
A common form of silicon, silicon dioxide, may differ in details of
structure and purity with changes in dissolution and surface properties.
In high concentrations, hydroxide and fluoride may both etch at appreciable
rates 
\cite{Bossert_Urban_Maceroni_hydrofluoric_acid_free_2019}
but as optic people know even finger prints can stain glass
and organic acids have some dissolution abilities mostly at higher
pH \cite{BENNETT19881521}.
\mjmtol{ another hour trying to get bibtex wtf? }
Silicate urinary stones occur  in dogs
although not as commonly as other types 
\cite{Osborne_Jacob_Lulich_Canine_Silica_Urolithiasis_1999}
\cite{Urinary_calculi_small_Wenkel_Berg_1998}
 and can be induced in humans with
supplements containing silicon sources
\cite{FLYTHE2009127}.


\section{ Results }

Adding inositol, olive oil ( EVOO ) , and incidental CDP choline
and PABA appeared to restore energy in  everyone
and remove minor feeding indifference
in Rocky.  After a couple weeks, it was noted that Happy would be quiet
at time she used to cough. 


The monthly diet characteristics are  described in the 
appendix \mjmrefapp{diettab} for several contrasting months.
In the Spring of 2019 Happy had a cough free period that was
never well repeated. The months prior to Oct 2025 she was coughing
a bit with good energy but notably acting slower than in 2019 or
when Daisy was first introduced to her a few years before. 
A variety of caveats and footnotes
are associated with the diet records. For a more complete
discussion see the earlier manuscript \cite{marchywka-MJM-2024-010-0.01rg} .
Briefly, 2 supplemented snacks were generally given each day
with consistent and rotating components. 
Care was taken to either server immediately or within a few hours
and stored in a refrigerator due to concerns about reactions 
particulary with copper supplements. Vitamins for specific snacks
were selected for many considerations including mutual interactions
in the recipe and once consumed.  
Commercial kibble dinners
were also given but not well recorded and other components 
such as table scraps and yard debris were sometimes  consumed.
Total calories are not reflected in the records. 

Happy went through a period of reduced coughing early on the arrival
of Daisy. Neither the EVOO nor inositol were considered at that time
although incidental consumption could occur through foods or vitamin
D which was usually mixed with EVOO. 

Its also worth noting marrow was largely discontinued soon 
after Annie died.

In the month of Oct 2025 and following Rocky ate very eagerly even
getting up in the morning with everyone else which he had not 
consistently done before although otherwsie ate vigorously.
Dexter expressed more consistent eagerness although continuing to
eat only one meal a day. 
It will be interesting to see if these new components reduced his
need for supplemental zinc. 
\mjmtol{ once formulated split into discussion as approporiate } 
Its been difficult to give him any copper
since he only eats the riboflavin snack now but that may be worth
adding back to his overall diet too as apparently the lack of
zinc was a bigger problem than any possible copper toxicity.

\section{Discussion}
The initial motivation was to get Happy back to a cough free high
energy state similar to 2019. It becamse evident however small
benefits appeared in the other dogs such as more consisent enthusiasm
about eating. 

Annie's feeding hesitatancy partially resolved with zinc earlier but
its likely she had decliming kidney function for sometime. Dexter had
been eating mostly consistently but is now completely consistent and
more animtated. Rocky too eliminated any indifference. 

Confusing results with inositol, a prescursor or skeleton for
several signalling molecules, are probably due to adaptive
responses under a variety of other limitations or states.
That is, the heart is supposed to grow to accomodate additional
load as occurs with exercise. Growth may occur due to cell growth,
proliferation, or deposition of various matrix proteins. Each of
these may be limited by different resources and have different outcomes
on heart function. Inositol status may not be able to achieve a more
beneficial result in all cases just reduce one which appears to be
pathological. Signalling may be a best guess over evolutionary time
scales for reproductive age individuals but may have some flaws. 

Since inositol can be synthesized and is plentiful in the diet its
important to consider why supplementation would be beneficial especially
if age related and not generally provable. Age related GI atrophy
has been considered before 

and the steps needed to free and absorb inositol investigated for potential
bottlenecks. While internal synthesis could also decrease with age, 
its also possible, although not suggested,  that requirements increase with
age.  

The contributions of these components to clinical outcomes remains
undertermined but empirically this appears to work well on this group of
dogs. Its much easier to work backward from a known working solution
and tweak values or remove things than it is to look for small signals
in a trial of a partial solution. 
If non-interacting and only one is active, from a group of N
it would be possile to find "the one " in log base 2 trials instead
of N trials by testin half of the candidates at once. 
Mixing things always creates risks
but testing one partial solution at a time may not provide enough
signal to be informative. In all of these cases, the hope is to
find unexpected but stark error signals unless of course a 
solution emerges by luck. 


\mjmtol{ need citations of course, case reports on other cause hypoglycemia
and see if there is a pattern of symptom severity. Sugar per se is not a 
clinical endpoint.  
Earlier, lipoic acid was considered a suspect due to insulin mimetic
properties in dogs. In one case of poisoning, blood sugar reached
undetectable (  $<$1.1 mmol/L [20 mg/dL] ) and remained low for days
 yet the dog survived\cite{Loftin_2009}. 
Note of course that blood level does not reflect velocity and consumption
could be high with production almost keeping up. In which case
cells are burning a lot of it and in no need of any other fuel. 
Its likely that sugar can be as much a nuisance as a fuel. 
While clinical hypoglycemia apparently occurs,
it may be the case that lipids can largely replace it under the
right conditions.  
As lipoic acid is thought to increase uptake the former is more likely the
case }

Previously, I considered the ability of lipoic acid
to reduce blood sugar to control cancer. It may be that inositol 
could be of benefit here with reduced blood sugar and better signalling
which could allow cells to better fit into their environment. 
Insulin resistance is thought to precede and facilitate cancer 
\cite{PMID41202839} and that may be partially causal but also
related to associated signalling systems. There is some reason to
consider inositol as a possible factor. 
 
\subsection{Picky Eating }
This set of ingredients made all six dogs eat enthusiastically
as they were all generally more animated. As with copper, energy
and "well being" may precede reversal of adaptations
to starvation such as weak or enlarged tissue. 
Eating "dysphoria" here has been a matter of degrees with diverse
suspects. With mild amounts absent a specific cause like dental pain,
considerations may include mild liver or kidney insufficiency or 
effective deficiency of some nutrient. Some benefits have been
seen with zinc, probably more likely when ALP is near zero,
and sodium benzoate which can enahance flavor, moderate microbes in mouth
and stomach,
and sequester amino acids. Zinc may also be suspected with a high
copper diet as used here. The current set of suspects may also
be broadly applicable to older dogs due to the reasons outlined earlier.



\subsection{Its the Greatest Derivative Charlie Brown }

The literature on nutrition and perhaps medicine in general
is filled with confusing or disappointing results. 
Its possible that a lot of anecdotes about folk remedies have
some basis but the critical components are not always identifed
leading to tests of single nutrients that may not even be given
to a population in the right state. 

Dose-response curves for entities of interest are going to 
be have a maximal benefit at some does while becoming perhaps
toxic at high doses. It is often pointed out but not fully 
appreciated that this "typical" curve applies to specific
current states and is just a section of a larger surface.
In the right state, the curve could "flat line" or even invert.
The result of a randomized trial would depend on the population
being explored.  For any given state, there is probably only
a small number of entities with easily measured positive slopes.
In this case, a prior success was identified and the suspects
were easy to test. 

Consider the case of inositol and thyroid hormone. While inositol
may have a signalling role, it can't replace say iodine or amino
acids required to respond to TSH.  Tested on a general population
of hypothyroid patients in isolation it may have no effect yet
the underlying cause of low inositol may be a combintation
of other nutrional issues.  






\section{Conclusions}
Certainly in retrospect both inositol and EVOO should have been 
considered for potential relevance. Prior work showing inconsistent
results often tried to test "one thing" against a random background
state consisting of genetirc and metabolics. Except for the case where
the sample is drawn from a population already replate with a variety
of other nutrients neither of these may show much effect. That is, the
differential response is not significant in any sense. The present work
again illustrates that randomization is not substitute for understanding
cause and effect or at least a better defined present state. While great 
advances have been made with empirical natural products, better solutions
may derive from using more of what is known and remembering "we have 
computers" to sort out difficult data. 
Certainly again luck provided the opportunity but it still needed
to be recognized.  Launching into a well controlled trial of a single
entity may not have produced even a useful error signal.
An incremtnal approach. staying locked to an error signal, builing
line upon line and precept upon precept, may make more sense
if it can be reduced to a cookbook formula.

\section{ Statement of Conflicts }
 No specific funding was used in this effort and there are no relationships
with others that could create a conflict of interest. I would like to develop
these ideas further and have obvious bias towards making them appear 
successful. Barbara Cade, the dog owner, has worked in the pet food industry
but this does not likely create a conflict. We have no interest in the
makers of any of the products named in this work.
