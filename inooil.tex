\section{Introduction  }

A previous recent report detailed the overall safety and
possible benefits of copper supplemetation in a group of dogs
with heart benefits thought to be the most relevant
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2024-010-0.01rg} .
However, results were not entirely successful particularly in the
case of Happy who never achieved "cough free" status as
she had briefly in 2019. Further lack of progress
motivated a more detailed
examination of the last known working diet which revealed
likely contributors to overall health. 


Extra virgin olive oil
had been greatly reduced and also "other" components of the
GNC-100 vitamin used earlier were considered as lost contributors
as this multi-vitamin was replaced by components. Several suspects
were uncovered with inositol considered quite probably important.  

Subsequently, 2 of the dogs, Annie and Trixie,  have died.
Generally all of them appeared a little duller over the past year
after moving to a new location.

\section{ Discovery and Consideration of Suspects }

An inability to entirely return Happy to here high-energy cough-free
state motivated a more careful examination of the last known working
diet from early 2019. The two most obvious suspects were extra
virgin olive oil (EVOO ) and ignored components of the GNC B-100
supplement. The latter containing all of those considere below except
the EVOO, see the picture.  


Olive oil is a complex natural product and a perenial suspect 
with many questions and paradoxes
\cite{10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00545-4}ZZ
. Currently most health benefits are thought to relate to
the monounsaturated oleic acid which is the majority 
of extra virgin olive oil although many other components
are potentially active such as polyphenols and
hydroxytyrosol  \cite{LU2024529}
\cite{Milena_Maurizio_Exploring_Cardiovascular_Benefits_2025}
.
In addition to these well considered functions, it could also act
as a simple yet unique solvet or fuel. 

Inositol literature was also highly suggestive of a wide range of
benefits but no compelling evidence exists or specific efficacy
and endogenous production is often considere sufficient..
Inositol and derivatives may relate to various stresses in a range
of organisms such as salt stress in the plant Tamarix ramosissima
\cite{Li_Fan_Zhang_Effects_Inositol_2023}
and acute ammonia toxicity in fish 
\cite{Wang_Meng_Liu_Exogenous_inositol_ameliorates_2021}.
It is  important to note that high inositol has been
associated with both heart and kidney pathology suggesting
it has a pathological role \cite{Pouleur_Menghoum_Cumps_Plasma_inositol_elevation_2024} 
and " stimulates the transcription of genes underlying hypertrophic growth."
\cite{Demydenko_EkhteraeiTousi_Roderick_Inositol_2022}.

But many results show beneficial effects of exogenous
inositol or phosphate derivatives.
One recent review considers heart and brain disease, diabetes, 
cancer and reproductive health \cite{Chhetri_Inositol_2019}.
Some reports of heart benefits   include
moderation of pathological effects of high fat diet
on heart including improved rhythm and reduced remodeling
\cite{LABBATE2020105047}

or indirectly by improved oxygen delivery from hemoglobin
\cite{Biolo_Greferath_Siwik_Enhanced_exercise_capacity_2009}
. It also reduced effects of toxic lithium dosing
in several measures of heart quatli. \cite{LABBATE2024117287}.



Other  benefits exist for conditions such as 
diabetic nephropathy
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.23032}
cisplatin exposure \cite{Xie_Wang_Li_Role_inositol_2023}
\cite{Qi_Deng_Wang_Inositol_Supplementation_Alleviates_2023} 

A 2016 report found that inositol was likely safe for
dogs and cat but lacking any benefit
\cite{https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4511}.


Inositol phosphates form a family of  signalling
molecules which seem to be common in eukaryotic cells
\cite{Laha_PortelaTorres_Desfougeres_Inositol_phosphate_kinases_2021}
.
Carefully regulated inositol seems to be needed for
proper development of Drosophila melanogaster \cite{PMC8565467}
and an inositol hexaphosphate kinase may have an effect on
lifespan in mice \cite{Moritoh_Oka_Yasuhara_Inositol_Hexakisphosphate_Kinase_2016}.
ZZ
It may also have a role to play in thyroid health especially in 
cases of boarderline low hormone output 
\cite{PMC8143049} as has been suspected previously to be a common
problem in dogs. 

While inositol is synthesized the overall regulation of synthesis,
uptake, and elimination is not well uderstood
\cite{Su_Ko_Saiardi_Regulations_inositol_2023}.




PABA was also added but a concern due to possible thyroid issues which
have been a problem as descirbed before.

Choline bitartate has recently been associated with stones in dogs
\cite{PMC12035869}
and so an althernatve, CDP choline was used.
This has been used in various experiments with dogs
\cite{PMC9151482}
\cite{PMID34715589}
with at least no obvious acute issues. 
 Choline is not considered
a likely suspect due to the egg and lecithin content of the background
diet but could not be ruled out. 


Additional suspects included silicon dioxide. The biology of silicon
is not well known and generally "sand" is considered inert
at some point sodium metasilicate may be worth testing if it can
be done safely ( pH control and avoid side reactions). 
I obained some food grade silica but never came up with a strategy
for feeding to the dogs. 
Silica appears in the Carlson copper supplement and possibly others.

\mjmpicture{nc100_label.png}{ Label from a recent version of the product similar to original. The mcg units on inositol is thought to be a mistake although no attempt was made to investigate. }{gnclab}

\section{ Results }

Adding inositol, olive oil ( EVOO ) , and incidental CDP choline
and PABA appeared to restore energy in  everyone
and remove minor feeding indifference
in Rocky.  After a couple weeks, it was noted that Happy would be quiet
at time she used to cough. 


The final diet is described in the appendix \mjmrefapp{diettab}  but most notably
inositol and olive oil were added to tbe already comprehsive list
of additives including copper.

Happy went through a period of reduced coughing early on the arrival
of Daisy. Neither the EVOO nor inositol were considered at that time
although incidental consumption could occur through foods or vitamin
D which was usually mixed with EVOO. 

Its unfortunate that Annie and Trixie died before this diet could
be introduced to them.

Its also worth noting marrow was discontinued soon after Annie died.


\mjmtol{

\section{Discussion}
The initial motivation was to get Happy back to a cough free high
energy state similar to 2019. It becamse evident however small
benefits appeared in the other dogs such as more consisent enthusiasm
about eating. 

Annie's feeding hesitatancy partially resolved with zinc earlier but
its likely she had decliming kidney function for sometime. Dexter had
been eating mostly consistently but is now completely consistent and
more animtated. Rocky too eliminated any indifference. 

Confusing results with inositol, a prescursor or skeleton for
several signalling molecules, are probably due to adaptive
responses under a variety of other limitations or states.
That is, the heart is supposed to grow to accomodate additional
load as occurs with exercise. Growth may occur due to cell growth,
proliferation, or deposition of various matrix proteins. Each of
these may be limited by different resources and have different outcomes
on heart function. Inositol status may not be able to achieve a more
beneficial result in all cases just reduce one which appears to be
pathological. Signalling may be a best guess over evolutionary time
scales for reproductive age individuals but may have some flaws. 
 



\section{Its the Greatest Derivative Charlie Brown }

The literature on nutrition and perhaps medicine in general
is filled with confusing or disappointing results. 
Its possible that a lot of anecdotes about folk remedies have
some basis but the critical components are not always identifed
leading to tests of single nutrients that may not even be given
to a population in the right state. 

Dose-response curves for entities of interest are going to 
be have a maximal benefit at some does while becoming perhaps
toxic at high doses. It is often pointed out but not fully 
appreciated that this "typical" curve applies to specific
current states and is just a section of a larger surface.
In the right state, the curve could "flat line" or even invert.
The result of a randomized trial would depend on the population
being explored.  For any given state, there is probably only
a small number of entities with easily measured positive slopes.
In this case, a prior success was identified and the suspects
were easy to test. 

Consider the case of inositol and thyroid hormone. While inositol
may have a signalling role, it can't replace say iodine or amino
acids required to respond to TSH.  Tested on a general population
of hypothyroid patients in isolation it may have no effect yet
the underlying cause of low inositol may be a combintation
of other nutrional issues.  






\section{Conclusions}
Certainly in retrospect both inositol and EVOO should have been 
considered for potential relevance. Prior work showing inconsistent
results often tried to test "one thing" against a random background
state consisting of genetirc and metabolics. Except for the case where
the sample is drawn from a population already replate with a variety
of other nutrients neither of these may show much effect. That is, the
differential response is not significant in any sense. The present work
again illustrates that randomization is not substitute for understanding
cause and effect or at least a better defined present state. While great 
advances have been made with empirical natural products, better solutions
may derive from using more of what is known and remembering "we have 
computers" to sort out difficult data. 
Certainly again luck provided the opportunity but it still needed
to be recognized.  Launching into a well controlled trial of a single
entity may not have produced even a useful error signal.
An incremtnal approach. staying locked to an error signal, builing
line upon line and precept upon precept, may make more sense
if it can be reduced to a cookbook formula.

\section{ Statement of Conflicts }
 No specific funding was used in this effort and there are no relationships
with others that could create a conflict of interest. I would like to develop
these ideas further and have obvious bias towards making them appear 
successful. Barbara Cade, the dog owner, has worked in the pet food industry
but this does not likely create a conflict. We have no interest in the
makers of any of the products named in this work.

\section{About the Authors and Facility}
This work was performed at a dog rescue run by Barbara Cade and
housed in rural Georgia.  The author of this report 
,Mike Marchywka,
has a background in electrical engineering and 
has done extensive research using free online literature sources.  
I hope to find additional people interested in critically 
examining the results and verify that they can be reproduced
effectively to treat other dogs.
