abstract = {Myo-inositol is a precursor of the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI). It is involved in many essential cellular processes including signal transduction, energy metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and osmoregulation. Inositol is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate by myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPSp). The Drosophila melanogaster Inos gene encodes MIPSp. Abnormalities in myo-inositol metabolism have been implicated in type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Obesity and high blood (hemolymph) glucose are two hallmarks of diabetes, which can be induced in Drosophila melanogaster third-instar larvae by high-sucrose diets. This study shows that dietary inositol reduces the obese-like and high-hemolymph glucose phenotypes of third-instar larvae fed high-sucrose diets. Furthermore, this study demonstrates Inos mRNA regulation by dietary inositol; when more inositol is provided there is less Inos mRNA. Third-instar larvae with dysregulated high levels of Inos mRNA and MIPSp show dramatic reductions of the obese-like and high-hemolymph glucose phenotypes. These strains, however, also display developmental defects and pupal lethality. The few individuals that eclose die within two days with striking defects: structural alterations of the wings and legs, and heads lacking proboscises. This study is an exciting extension of the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for exploring the junction of development and metabolism.},

abstract = {Myo-Inositol (MYO) is the most abundant stereoisomer of inositols' family, cyclic polyols with 6 hydroxyl groups. Myo-Inositol has a relevant role in thyroid function and autoimmune diseases, as a precursor of phosphoinositides that takes part in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) signal transduction pathway. Among phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) is the precursor of inositol triphosphates (IP3), second messenger of several hormones including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). As a second messenger in the phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent inositol phosphate Ca(2+)/DAG pathway, Myo-Inositol is essential to produce H(2)O(2) required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Consequently, depletion of Myo-Inositol or impaired inositol dependent TSH signaling pathway may predispose to the development of some thyroid diseases, such as hypothyroidism. Many clinical studies have shown that after treatment with Myo-Inositol plus Selenium (MYO+Se), TSH levels significantly decreased in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism with or without autoimmune thyroiditis. The TSH reduction was accompanied by a decline of antithyroid autoantibodies. Moreover, Myo-Inositol supplementation seemed to be involved also in the management of thyroidal benign nodules, with a possible effect in the size reduction. This review proposes a summary of the role of inositol, especially of Myo-Inositol, in the thyroidal physiology and its contribution on the management of some thyroid diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcium tartrate tetrahydrate (CTT) uroliths are recently identified in dogs. OBJECTIVES: To report on the types and prevalence of diets, supplements, and medications containing salts of tartaric acid consumed by dogs with CTT urolithiasis. ANIMALS: Sixty-three client-owned dogs identified with CTT uroliths from a single urolith analysis laboratory. METHODS: Retrospective case series evaluating dogs with CTT uroliths and their prevalence of consuming diets, supplements, and medications containing salts of tartaric acid before diagnosis of urolithiasis. RESULTS: Dogs with CTT uroliths were predominantly male (53/63, 84%) small purebreds (48/63, 76%). Thirty-three of 63 cases provided additional information by completing our survey. In 25 of 33 (76%) cases, a source of tartaric acid was identified in diets, supplements, or medications. In 24 of these 25 cases (96%), the source of tartaric acid was choline bitartrate. CONCLUSIONS: When investigating a cause for CTT uroliths in dogs, consider diets and supplements containing choline bitartrate as a potential source of urolith components.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New drugs for veterinary patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are urgently needed. Early or late postinfection treatment of influenza-infected mice with the liponucleotide cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) resulted in decreased hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung dysfunction, and inflammation without altering viral replication. These findings suggested CDP-choline could have benefit as adjunctive treatment for ARDS in veterinary patients (VetARDS). OBJECTIVES: Determine if parenterally administered CDP-choline can attenuate mild VetARDS in dogs with aspiration pneumonia. ANIMALS: Dogs admitted to a veterinary intensive care unit (ICU) for aspiration pneumonia. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with vehicle (0.1 mL/kg sterile 0.9% saline, IV; n = 8) or CDP-choline (5 mg/kg in 0.1 mL/kg 0.9% saline, IV; n = 9) q12h over the first 48 hours after ICU admission. RESULTS: No significant differences in signalment or clinical findings were found between placebo- and CDP-choline-treated dogs on admission. All dogs exhibited tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hypoxemia, hypocapnia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. CDP-choline administration resulted in rapid, progressive, and clinically relevant increases in oxygenation as determined by pulse oximetry and ratios of arterial oxygen partial pressure (P(a) O(2) mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (% F(i) O(2) ) and decreases in alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradients that did not occur in placebo (saline)-treated animals. Treatment with CDP-choline was also associated with less platelet consumption over the first 48 hours, but had no detectable detrimental effects. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Ctyidine diphosphcholine acts rapidly to promote gas exchange in dogs with naturally occurring aspiration pneumonia and is a potential adjunctive treatment in VetARDS patients.},

abstract = {Endotoxin shock is associated with severe impairments in cardiovascular and respiratory functions. We showed previously that choline or cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) provides beneficial effects in experimental endotoxin shock in dogs. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of choline or CDP-choline on endotoxin-induced cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunctions. Dogs were treated intravenously (i.v.) with saline or endotoxin (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before i.v. infusion of saline, choline (20 mg/kg) or CDP-choline (70 mg/kg). Blood pressure, cardiac rate, myocardial and left ventricular functions, respiratory rate, blood gases, serum electrolytes and cardiac injury markers were determined before and at 0.5-48 h after endotoxin. Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), catecholamine and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured 2 h and 24 h after the treatments. Endotoxin caused immediate and sustained reductions in blood pressure, cardiac output, pO(2) and pH; changes in left ventricular functions, structure and volume parameters; and elevations in heart rate, respiratory rate, pCO2 and serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Ca and P). Endotoxin also resulted in elevations in blood levels of cardiac injury markers, TNF-alpha, HMGB1, catecholamine and NO. In choline- or CDP-choline-treated dogs, all endotoxin effects were much smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration than observed values in controls. These data show that treatment with choline or CDP-choline improves functions of cardiovascular and respiratory systems in experimental endotoxemia and suggest that they may be useful in treatment of endotoxin shock in clinical setting.},
