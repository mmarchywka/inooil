Inositol is an essential micronutrient for salmon, carp, tilapia and shrimps, particularly juveniles. In a previous opinion on inositol, the EFSA Panel\NBSPon Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP6) could not conclude on the safety and efficacy of inositol when used in pet food at the recommended use levels of between 500 and 3,000\NBSPmg/kg owing to insufficient evidence. The European Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluate the safety and efficacy of inositol when used as nutritional additive (functional group: vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having a similar effect) in food for dogs and cats. In the present application, the applicant proposed a maximum supplementation level of 1,500\NBSPmg inositol/kg dry complete feed for dogs and cats. The FEEDAP Panel\NBSPconcluded, based on the free inositol concentrations found in commercial diets for pets, that inositol up to a total content of 3,000\NBSPmg free inositol/kg dry complete feed (88\% dry matter) could be considered safe for dogs and cats. Evidence is lacking for any benefit of inositol supplementation of foods for dogs and cats.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Myo-inositol, a carbocyclic sugar, is believed to be relevant to renal pathobiology since the kidney is the major site for its catabolism. Its role in acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been fully investigated. Ferroptosis, a unique form of regulated cell death, is involved in various types of renal injuries. The relevance of myo-inositol with respect to the process of ferroptosis has not been explored either. Herein, our current exploratory studies revealed that supplementation of myo-inositol attenuates cisplatin-induced injury in cultured Boston University mouse proximal tubular (BUMPT) cells and renal tubules in vivo. Moreover, our studies unraveled that metabolic parameters pertaining to ferroptosis were disrupted in cisplatin-treated proximal tubular cells, which were seemingly remedied by the administration of myo-inositol. Mechanistically, we noted that cisplatin treatment led to the up-regulation of NOX4, a key enzyme relevant to ferroptosis, which was normalized by the administration of myo-inositol. Furthermore, we observed that changes in the NOX4 expression induced by cisplatin or myo-inositol were modulated by carboxy-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Taken together, our investigation suggests that myo-inositol promotes CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of NOX4 to decelerate the process of ferroptosis, leading to the amelioration of cisplatin-induced AKI.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Abstract Recent studies have emphasized the role of mitochondria in renal function as well as in renal injury. Poor mitochondrial quality control mechanisms including mitochondrial fusion, fission and mitophagy are major contributors for progression of diabetic renal injury. The current study is aimed to evaluate the protective role of myo-inositol (MI) against diabetic nephropathy (DN) by utilizing high glucose exposed NRK 52E cell and streptozotocin (STZ) induced DN model. MI supplementation (at doses 37.5\NBSPand 75mg/kg) ameliorated albuminuria and enhanced the renal function as indicated significant improvement in urinary creatinine and urea levels. On the other hand, the western blot analysis of both in vitro and in vivo studies has revealed poor mitophagy in renal cells which was reversed upon myo-inositol treatment. Apart from targeting the canonical PINK1/Parkin pathway, we also focused on the role mitophagy receptors prohibitin (PHB) and NIP3-like protein (NIX). A significant reduction in expression of NIX and PHB2 was observed in renal tissue of diabetic control rats and high glucose exposed NRK 52E cells. Myo-inositol treatment resulted in positive modulation of PINK1/Parkin pathway as well as PHB2 and NIX. Myo-inositol also enhanced the mitochondrial biogenesis in renal tissue of diabetic rat by upregulating Nrf2/SIRT1/PGC-1upalpha axis. The current study thus underlines the renoprotective effect myo-inositol, upregulation of mitophagy proteins and mitochondrial biogenesis upon myo-inositol treatment.},

Consistent with increased tissue oxygen availability, ITPP decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1upalpha mRNA expression in myocardium.

Thus, ITPP decreases the oxygen binding affinity of Hb, increases tissue oxygen delivery, and increases maximal exercise capacity in normal mice and mice with severe heart failure. ITPP is thus an attractive candidate for the therapy of patients with reduced exercise capacity caused by heart failure. </jats:p>},

abstract = {Obesity is an independent risk factor to develop cardiac functional and structural impairments. Here, we investigated the effects of supplementation of inositols on the electrical, structural, and functional cardiac alterations in the mouse model of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Three groups of C57BL6 mice (n = 16 each) were studied: j) HFD feeding; jj) HFD feeding + inositols from week 9 to 13; jjj) standard diet feeding. Study observation period was 13 weeks. Inositols were administered as mixture of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in the drinking water. Effects of inositols were evaluated based on electrical, structural, and functional cardiac features, autonomic sympatho-vagal balance and arrhythmogenic susceptibility to adrenergic challenge. Heart samples were collected for histological evaluations and transcriptional analyses of genes involved in defining the shape and propagation of the action potential, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Inositol supplementation significantly restored control values of heart rate and QTc interval on ECG and of sympatho-vagal balance. Moreover, it blunted the increase in left ventricular mass and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reversed diastolic dysfunction, reduced the susceptibility to arrhythmic events and restored the expression level of cardiac genes altered by HFD. The present study shows, for the first time, how a short period of supplementation with inositols is able to ameliorate the HFD-induced electrical, structural and functional heart alterations including ventricular remodeling. Results provide a new insight into the cardioprotective effect of inositols, which could pave the way for a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of HFD obesity-induced heart dysfunction.},

abstract = {<jats:p>NaCl stress adversely affects plant growth. Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb (T. ramosissima), a halophyte, thrives in saline-alkali areas. Myo-inositol, a lipid-soluble compound, is crucial for stress response, but its role in mitigating NaCl damage remains underexplored. We analyzed transcriptome sequencing and metabolites in T. ramosissima roots under NaCl stress at various intervals (0 h, 48 h, and 168 h). We identified ten Myo-inositol oxygenase-related genes. Nine of these genes, linked to metabolic pathways involving Myo-inositol, showed differential expression. Myo-inositol accumulation increased over time, suggesting its role as an osmotic regulator and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. This accumulation likely shields T. ramosissima from NaCl-induced osmotic and oxidative damage. Notably, Unigene0002140 and Unigene0095980, associated with Myo-inositol oxygenase, appear to regulate Myo-inositol accumulation and correlate significantly with its levels. We hypothesize they are key genes in controlling Myo-inositol levels, warranting further study. This research illuminates the role of Myo-inositol oxygenase-related genes in T. ramosissima roots combating NaCl stress, offering insights for selecting salt-tolerant tree species.</jats:p>},

The study involved 4 groups of C57BL6 mice (n=10 each): (i) mice orally administered with Li2CO3 for 8 weeks, then 4 additional weeks without (Li_group) or (ii) with INO supplementation (Li_INOdelayed_group) (total of 12 weeks); (iii) mice given Li2CO3 and INO supplementation concurrently for 12 weeks (Li+INO_group); (iv) one group left untreated (C-group). The INO was administered as a mixture of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (80:1) in drinking water. The mice were characterised for heart morphology, function, electrical activity, arrhythmogenic susceptibility, and multiorgan histopathology (heart, liver and kidney). Cardiomyocyte size, protein expression of key signalling pathways related to hypertrophy, and transcription levels of ion channel subunits and hypertrophy markers were evaluated in the ventricle tissue. The study found that INO supplementation reduced the Li-induced cardiac adverse effects, including systolic impairment and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. The positive effect on arrhythmias might be attributed to the restored expression levels of the potassium channel subunit Kv 1.5. Additionally, INO improved cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, possibly by inhibiting the Li-induced activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway and by restoring the normal expression level of BNP, and alleviated injury in the liver and kidney. The effect was preventive if INO supplementation was taken concurrently with Li and therapeutic if INO was administered after Li-induced cardiac impairments were established. These results provide new insights into the cardioprotective effect of INO and suggest a potential treatment approach for Li-induced cardiac disease.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean diet has long been recognized as one of the most effective ways to prevent and improve cardiovascular disease. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the typical sources of fat in the Mediterranean diet which have been shown to have noteworthy nutritional value and positive impact on human health. It is worth noting that EVOO owes its superior nutritional value to its bioactive composition. The main component of EVOO is monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in the form of oleic acid. Oleic acid accounts for up to 70 %80 % of EVOO. Secondly, EVOO contains approximately more than 30 phenolic compounds, of which HT is essential for the protection against cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focused on the potential mechanisms of oleic acid and polyphenols combat cardiovascular diseases risk in terms of oxidative stress, inflammation, blood pressure, endothelial function and cholesterol. This review might provide a reference for the studies on cardiovascular protective effects of EVOO.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, driven by complex interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with diet playing a pivotal role. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), is a plant-based fat that has garnered attention for its robust cardiovascular benefits, which are attributed to its unique composition of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid (OA); and bioactive polyphenols, such as Hydroxytyrosol (HT) and oleocanthal. These compounds collectively exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and lipid-modulating effects. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that EVOO's properties reduce major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. EVOO also promotes endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thus favoring vasodilation, lowering blood pressure (BP), and supporting vascular integrity. Furthermore, it modulates biomarkers of cardiovascular health, such as C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and NT-proBNP, aligning with improved hemostatic balance and reduced arterial vulnerability. Emerging evidence highlights its interaction with gut microbiota, further augmenting its cardioprotective effects.

abstract_as_rcvd = {<jats:p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, driven by complex interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with diet playing a pivotal role. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), is a plant-based fat that has garnered attention for its robust cardiovascular benefits, which are attributed to its unique composition of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid (OA); and bioactive polyphenols, such as Hydroxytyrosol (HT) and oleocanthal. These compounds collectively exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and lipid-modulating effects. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that EVOOâ€™s properties reduce major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. EVOO also promotes endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thus favoring vasodilation, lowering blood pressure (BP), and supporting vascular integrity. Furthermore, it modulates biomarkers of cardiovascular health, such as C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and NT-proBNP, aligning with improved hemostatic balance and reduced arterial vulnerability. Emerging evidence highlights its interaction with gut microbiota, further augmenting its cardioprotective effects. This review synthesizes current evidence, elucidating EVOOâ€™s multifaceted mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Future directions emphasize the need for advanced extraction techniques, nutraceutical formulations, and personalized dietary recommendations to maximize its health benefits. EVOO represents a valuable addition to dietary strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p xml:lang=en>4-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA, para-aminobenzoic acid) exhibits multifaceted therapeutic potential in neuropsychiatric disorders through its roles in neurotransmitter modulation, anti-inflammatory action, and antioxidant defense. Experimental and clinical evidence demonstrates that PABA enhances serotonin and dopamine synthesis by activating key enzymes (e.g., tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase), thereby stabilizing mood and improving cognitive function. Mechanistically, PABA suppresses neuroinflammation by inhibiting NF-upkappaB signaling and cytokine production (e.g., IL-1upbeta, TNF-upalpha) while scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate oxidative stress and protect neuronal integrity. Clinical studies indicate that PABA may synergize with traditional antidepressants by targeting serotonin reuptake transporters (SERT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), offering improved outcomes in major depressive disorder. Despite promising results, further research is needed to optimize dosing regimens, validate long-term safety, and explore pharmacogenomic interactions. Crucially, experimental validation through cellular and animal models is required to substantiate PABA's proposed mechanisms, particularly its regulation of NF-upkappaB signaling and enzyme activity in neurotransmitter synthesis. This review underscores PABA's potential as a neuroprotective agent and calls for integrated strategies to translate mechanistic insights into clinical applications for complex neurological conditions.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) alters the sensitivity of tumor cells to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Materials: Cellular proliferation was assessed by WST-1 assays. The effects of PABA and radiation on tumor growth were examined with chick embryo and murine models. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to quantify p21CIP1 and CDC25A levels. Results: Para-aminobenzoic acid enhanced (by 50%) the growth inhibitory activity of radiation on B16F10 cells, whereas it had no effect on melanocytes. Para-aminobenzoic acid enhanced (50-80%) the antitumor activity of radiation on B16F10 and 4T1 tumors in vivo. The combination of PABA and radiation therapy increased tumor apoptosis. Treatment of tumor cells with PABA increased expression of CDC25A and decreased levels of p21CIP1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PABA might represent a compound capable of enhancing the antitumor activity of ionizing radiation by a mechanism involving altered expression of proteins known to regulate cell cycle arrest.},

abstract = {MUCH ATTENTION has been focussed recently on the effects of thiourea. and thiouracil on thyroid structure and function. These drugs have been found to induce the formation of an enlarged hyperplasti thyroid gland in the mammal, bird, amphibian and fish.This state is associated with a condition of functional hypothyroidism due to the interference by the drugs with the production of normal thyroid principle. Recently it has been reported that rats treated with these drugs display an increased resistance to lowered barometric pressures (Gordon, Goldsmith and Charipper, 1944a; Leblond, 1944; Hughes and Astwood, 1944) which results, at least partly, from the ability of these agents to interferewith thyroid function.The aminobenzoic acids also have been found to produce a goitrogenic effect in rats (the Mackenzies, 1943). This is of considerable interest since para aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a naturally occurring food factor, is the most effective of the three (Astwood, 1943.},

abstract = {Summary A decreased level of thyroid activity, induced by thyroidectomy, thiouracil or p-aminobenzoic acid feeding, prevents or retards the development of hepatic necrosis or fibrosis associated with choline and cystine deficiencies. Although thyroid feeding hastened the death of choline-deficient rats, their livers contained little fat and showed no necrosis or fibrosis. Thyroid feeding hastened the death of cystine-deficient rats; their livers exhibited the acute necrosis characteristic of this deficiency. Rats living on a commercial chow were more resistant to the toxic effects of hyperthyroidism than animals on our best synthetic ration. The further addition of choline or methionine to this synthetic diet somewhat increased the susceptibility of rats to thyroid toxicity. Animals on low protein diets were more susceptible to thyroid toxicity than those on high protein diets, and animals on high fat diets were somewhat more resistant than those on low fat diets. Animals deficient in both cystine and choline were more susceptible to hyperthyroidism than any other group studied. The existence of an already established fatty liver appeared to protect the rat against thyrotoxicosis. The inclusion of sulfasuxidine, taurine or inositol in a choline-deficient diet prevented the development of cirrhosis during the experimental period but not by virtue of lipotropic action or antithyroid activity, as judged by liver fat content and the histological appearance of the thyroid.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Researchers' interest in silicon as an element important for the functioning of the animal and human body began in the 1970s. Soluble compounds of silicon bioavailable from water and food seem to have important meaning for life processes occurring in the body. So far, researchers have focused on the significance of silicon for the development of bones and connective tissue, and its role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. Despite numerous studies, the role of silicon as an active element in the human body is poorly understood. Since the involvement of lipid oxidation and inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is well known, this article summarizes and discusses the current research and scientific observations regarding silicon, primarily in terms of its beneficial influence on redox and anti-inflammatory reactions and the lipid profile. The association of silicon with the stabilization of the structure of glycosaminoglycans and their protein complexes may also support the anti-atherosclerotic effect. The authors attempted to collect and present existing publications that could confirm the beneficial role of dietary silicon in the prevention of age-related diseases and explain the potential mechanisms of its action.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Phosphoinositides are a minor group of membrane-associated phospholipids that are transiently generated on the cytoplasmic leaflet of many organelle membranes and the plasma membrane. There are seven functionally distinct phosphoinositides, each derived via the reversible phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in various combinations on the inositol ring. Their generation and termination is tightly regulated by phosphatidylinositol-kinases and -phosphatases. These enzymes can function together in an integrated and coordinated manner, whereby the phosphoinositide product of one enzyme may subsequently serve as a substrate for another to generate a different phosphoinositide species. This regulatory mechanism not only enables the transient generation of phosphoinositides on membranes, but also more complex sequential or bidirectional conversion pathways, and phosphoinositides can also be transferred between organelles via membrane contacts. It is this capacity to fine-tune phosphoinositide signals that makes them ideal regulators of membrane organization and dynamics, through their recruitment of signalling, membrane altering and lipid transfer proteins. Research spanning several decades has provided extensive evidence that phosphoinositides are major gatekeepers of membrane organization, with roles in endocytosis, exocytosis, autophagy, lysosome dynamics, vesicular transport and secretion, cilia, inter-organelle membrane contact, endosome maturation and nuclear function. By contrast, there has been remarkably little known about the role of phosphoinositides at mitochondria - an enigmatic and major knowledge gap, with challenges in reliably detecting phosphoinositides at this site. Here we review recent significant breakthroughs in understanding the role of phosphoinositides in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic function.},

abstract = {Myo-inositol is a precursor of the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI). It is involved in many essential cellular processes including signal transduction, energy metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and osmoregulation. Inositol is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate by myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPSp). The Drosophila melanogaster Inos gene encodes MIPSp. Abnormalities in myo-inositol metabolism have been implicated in type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Obesity and high blood (hemolymph) glucose are two hallmarks of diabetes, which can be induced in Drosophila melanogaster third-instar larvae by high-sucrose diets. This study shows that dietary inositol reduces the obese-like and high-hemolymph glucose phenotypes of third-instar larvae fed high-sucrose diets. Furthermore, this study demonstrates Inos mRNA regulation by dietary inositol; when more inositol is provided there is less Inos mRNA. Third-instar larvae with dysregulated high levels of Inos mRNA and MIPSp show dramatic reductions of the obese-like and high-hemolymph glucose phenotypes. These strains, however, also display developmental defects and pupal lethality. The few individuals that eclose die within two days with striking defects: structural alterations of the wings and legs, and heads lacking proboscises. This study is an exciting extension of the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for exploring the junction of development and metabolism.},

abstract = {Myo-Inositol (MYO) is the most abundant stereoisomer of inositols' family, cyclic polyols with 6 hydroxyl groups. Myo-Inositol has a relevant role in thyroid function and autoimmune diseases, as a precursor of phosphoinositides that takes part in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) signal transduction pathway. Among phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) is the precursor of inositol triphosphates (IP3), second messenger of several hormones including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). As a second messenger in the phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent inositol phosphate Ca(2+)/DAG pathway, Myo-Inositol is essential to produce H(2)O(2) required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Consequently, depletion of Myo-Inositol or impaired inositol dependent TSH signaling pathway may predispose to the development of some thyroid diseases, such as hypothyroidism. Many clinical studies have shown that after treatment with Myo-Inositol plus Selenium (MYO+Se), TSH levels significantly decreased in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism with or without autoimmune thyroiditis. The TSH reduction was accompanied by a decline of antithyroid autoantibodies. Moreover, Myo-Inositol supplementation seemed to be involved also in the management of thyroidal benign nodules, with a possible effect in the size reduction. This review proposes a summary of the role of inositol, especially of Myo-Inositol, in the thyroidal physiology and its contribution on the management of some thyroid diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcium tartrate tetrahydrate (CTT) uroliths are recently identified in dogs. OBJECTIVES: To report on the types and prevalence of diets, supplements, and medications containing salts of tartaric acid consumed by dogs with CTT urolithiasis. ANIMALS: Sixty-three client-owned dogs identified with CTT uroliths from a single urolith analysis laboratory. METHODS: Retrospective case series evaluating dogs with CTT uroliths and their prevalence of consuming diets, supplements, and medications containing salts of tartaric acid before diagnosis of urolithiasis. RESULTS: Dogs with CTT uroliths were predominantly male (53/63, 84%) small purebreds (48/63, 76%). Thirty-three of 63 cases provided additional information by completing our survey. In 25 of 33 (76%) cases, a source of tartaric acid was identified in diets, supplements, or medications. In 24 of these 25 cases (96%), the source of tartaric acid was choline bitartrate. CONCLUSIONS: When investigating a cause for CTT uroliths in dogs, consider diets and supplements containing choline bitartrate as a potential source of urolith components.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New drugs for veterinary patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are urgently needed. Early or late postinfection treatment of influenza-infected mice with the liponucleotide cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) resulted in decreased hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung dysfunction, and inflammation without altering viral replication. These findings suggested CDP-choline could have benefit as adjunctive treatment for ARDS in veterinary patients (VetARDS). OBJECTIVES: Determine if parenterally administered CDP-choline can attenuate mild VetARDS in dogs with aspiration pneumonia. ANIMALS: Dogs admitted to a veterinary intensive care unit (ICU) for aspiration pneumonia. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with vehicle (0.1 mL/kg sterile 0.9% saline, IV; n = 8) or CDP-choline (5 mg/kg in 0.1 mL/kg 0.9% saline, IV; n = 9) q12h over the first 48 hours after ICU admission. RESULTS: No significant differences in signalment or clinical findings were found between placebo- and CDP-choline-treated dogs on admission. All dogs exhibited tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hypoxemia, hypocapnia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. CDP-choline administration resulted in rapid, progressive, and clinically relevant increases in oxygenation as determined by pulse oximetry and ratios of arterial oxygen partial pressure (P(a) O(2) mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (% F(i) O(2) ) and decreases in alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradients that did not occur in placebo (saline)-treated animals. Treatment with CDP-choline was also associated with less platelet consumption over the first 48 hours, but had no detectable detrimental effects.

abstract = {Endotoxin shock is associated with severe impairments in cardiovascular and respiratory functions. We showed previously that choline or cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) provides beneficial effects in experimental endotoxin shock in dogs. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of choline or CDP-choline on endotoxin-induced cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunctions. Dogs were treated intravenously (i.v.) with saline or endotoxin (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before i.v. infusion of saline, choline (20 mg/kg) or CDP-choline (70 mg/kg). Blood pressure, cardiac rate, myocardial and left ventricular functions, respiratory rate, blood gases, serum electrolytes and cardiac injury markers were determined before and at 0.5-48 h after endotoxin. Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), catecholamine and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured 2 h and 24 h after the treatments. Endotoxin caused immediate and sustained reductions in blood pressure, cardiac output, pO(2) and pH; changes in left ventricular functions, structure and volume parameters; and elevations in heart rate, respiratory rate, pCO2 and serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Ca and P). Endotoxin also resulted in elevations in blood levels of cardiac injury markers, TNF-alpha, HMGB1, catecholamine and NO. In choline- or CDP-choline-treated dogs, all endotoxin effects were much smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration than observed values in controls. These data show that treatment with choline or CDP-choline improves functions of cardiovascular and respiratory systems in experimental endotoxemia and suggest that they may be useful in treatment of endotoxin shock in clinical setting.},

abstract = {A building block is a key component that plays a substantial and critical function in the pharmaceutical research and development industry. Given its structural versatility and ability to undergo substitutions at both the amino and carboxyl groups, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a commonly used building block in pharmaceuticals. Therefore, it is great for the development of a wide range of novel molecules with potential medical applications. Anticancer, anti-Alzheimer's, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties have been observed in PABA compounds, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents in future clinical trials. PABA-based therapeutic chemicals as molecular targets and their usage in biological processes are the primary focus of this review study. PABA's unique features make it a strong candidate for inclusion in a massive chemical database of molecules having drug-like effects. Based on the current literature, further investigation is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PABA derivatives in clinical investigations and better understand the specific mechanism of action revealed by these compounds.},

abstract = {Sulfonamide analogues of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a precursor of folate synthesis, have beneficial effects as antifolate, but thyroid peroxidase inhibition has been reported as a side effect that results in promotion of rat thyroid carcinogenesis. In the present study, effects of PABA itself on F344 rat thyroid carcinogenesis after initiation with N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine (DHPN) were evaluated. In experiment 1, rats in groups 1-4 received a single subcutaneous injection of DHPN at 2800 mg/kg, and groups 5 and 6 received vehicle saline alone. From 1 week after DHPN initiation, rats in groups 2, 3, 4, and 6 were fed basal diet containing 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.0% PABA, respectively, for 40 weeks. Rats in groups 1 and 5 received basal diet alone throughout the experiment. The final incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly (p < 0.05 or 0.01) increased in groups 3 and 4 as compared to group 1. No thyroid tumors were found in groups 5 and 6. In experiment 2, animals in group 1 were fed basal diet alone, while groups 2 and 3 were given 0.5% and 1.0% PABA in the diet, respectively, for 2 weeks. Thyroid weights in group 3, and serum thyroid stimulating hormone level and proliferative activity of follicular cells in groups 2 and 3 were significantly (p < 0.05 or 0.01) elevated. In addition, the serum thyroxine level in group 3 was significantly (p < 0.05) depressed. These results clearly indicate that PABA exerts promotion/progression effects on rat thyroid carcinogenesis as a result of hypothyroidism followed by negative-feedback via the thyroid-pituitary axis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the associations of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, and L-carnitine) with the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). This study sought to investigate these associations. METHODS: Prospective associations of these metabolites with incident AF and HF were examined among participants at high cardiovascular risk in the PREDIMED study (PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterrnea) after follow-up for about 10years. Two nested case-control studies were conducted, including 509 AF incident cases matched to 618 controls and 326 HF incident cases matched to 426 controls. Plasma levels of TMAO and its precursors were semi-quantitatively profiled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios were estimated with multivariable conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: After adjustment for classical risk factors and accounting for multiple testing, participants in the highest quartile vs. the lowest quartile of baseline choline and betaine levels had a higher risk of AF [OR (95% CI): 1.85 (1.30-2.63) and 1.57 (1.09-2.24), respectively]. The corresponding OR for AF for extreme quartiles of dimethylglycine was 1.39 (0.99-1.96). One SD increase in log-transformed dimethylglycine was positively associated with AF risk (OR, 1.17; 1.03-1.33). The corresponding ORs for HF for extreme quartiles of choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine were 2.51 (1.57-4.03), 1.65 (1.00-2.71) and 1.65 (1.04-2.61), respectively. TMAO and L-carnitine levels were not associated with AF or HF. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the role of the choline metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of AF and HF.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial dynamics regulated by mitochondrial fusion and fission maintain mitochondrial functions, whose alterations underline various human diseases. Here, we show that inositol is a critical metabolite directly restricting AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission independently of its classical mode as a precursor for phosphoinositide generation. Inositol decline by IMPA1/2 deficiency elicits AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission without affecting ATP level, whereas inositol accumulation prevents AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Metabolic stress or mitochondrial damage causes inositol decline in cells and mice to elicit AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Inositol directly binds to AMPKgamma and competes with AMP for AMPKgamma binding, leading to restriction of AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission. Our study suggests that the AMP/inositol ratio is a critical determinant for AMPK activation and establishes a model in which AMPK activation requires inositol decline to release AMPKgamma for AMP binding. Hence, AMPK is an inositol sensor, whose inactivation by inositol serves as a mechanism to restrict mitochondrial fission.},

abstract = {The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood(1-5). Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-beta and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3beta. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD.},
