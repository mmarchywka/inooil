Inositol is an essential micronutrient for salmon, carp, tilapia and shrimps, particularly juveniles. In a previous opinion on inositol, the EFSA Panel\NBSPon Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP6) could not conclude on the safety and efficacy of inositol when used in pet food at the recommended use levels of between 500 and 3,000\NBSPmg/kg owing to insufficient evidence. The European Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluate the safety and efficacy of inositol when used as nutritional additive (functional group: vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having a similar effect) in food for dogs and cats. In the present application, the applicant proposed a maximum supplementation level of 1,500\NBSPmg inositol/kg dry complete feed for dogs and cats. The FEEDAP Panel\NBSPconcluded, based on the free inositol concentrations found in commercial diets for pets, that inositol up to a total content of 3,000\NBSPmg free inositol/kg dry complete feed (88\% dry matter) could be considered safe for dogs and cats. Evidence is lacking for any benefit of inositol supplementation of foods for dogs and cats.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Myo-inositol, a carbocyclic sugar, is believed to be relevant to renal pathobiology since the kidney is the major site for its catabolism. Its role in acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been fully investigated. Ferroptosis, a unique form of regulated cell death, is involved in various types of renal injuries. The relevance of myo-inositol with respect to the process of ferroptosis has not been explored either. Herein, our current exploratory studies revealed that supplementation of myo-inositol attenuates cisplatin-induced injury in cultured Boston University mouse proximal tubular (BUMPT) cells and renal tubules in vivo. Moreover, our studies unraveled that metabolic parameters pertaining to ferroptosis were disrupted in cisplatin-treated proximal tubular cells, which were seemingly remedied by the administration of myo-inositol. Mechanistically, we noted that cisplatin treatment led to the up-regulation of NOX4, a key enzyme relevant to ferroptosis, which was normalized by the administration of myo-inositol. Furthermore, we observed that changes in the NOX4 expression induced by cisplatin or myo-inositol were modulated by carboxy-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Taken together, our investigation suggests that myo-inositol promotes CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of NOX4 to decelerate the process of ferroptosis, leading to the amelioration of cisplatin-induced AKI.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Abstract Recent studies have emphasized the role of mitochondria in renal function as well as in renal injury. Poor mitochondrial quality control mechanisms including mitochondrial fusion, fission and mitophagy are major contributors for progression of diabetic renal injury. The current study is aimed to evaluate the protective role of myo-inositol (MI) against diabetic nephropathy (DN) by utilizing high glucose exposed NRK 52E cell and streptozotocin (STZ) induced DN model. MI supplementation (at doses 37.5\NBSPand 75mg/kg) ameliorated albuminuria and enhanced the renal function as indicated significant improvement in urinary creatinine and urea levels. On the other hand, the western blot analysis of both in vitro and in vivo studies has revealed poor mitophagy in renal cells which was reversed upon myo-inositol treatment. Apart from targeting the canonical PINK1/Parkin pathway, we also focused on the role mitophagy receptors prohibitin (PHB) and NIP3-like protein (NIX). A significant reduction in expression of NIX and PHB2 was observed in renal tissue of diabetic control rats and high glucose exposed NRK 52E cells. Myo-inositol treatment resulted in positive modulation of PINK1/Parkin pathway as well as PHB2 and NIX. Myo-inositol also enhanced the mitochondrial biogenesis in renal tissue of diabetic rat by upregulating Nrf2/SIRT1/PGC-1upalpha axis. The current study thus underlines the renoprotective effect myo-inositol, upregulation of mitophagy proteins and mitochondrial biogenesis upon myo-inositol treatment.},

In normal mice, i.p. administration of ITPP (0.5-3 g/kg) caused a dose-related increase in the oxygen tension at which Hb is 50% saturated (p50), with a maximal increase of 31%.

ITPP increased exercise capacity, with a maximal increase of 63 \textpm 7% ( <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.005). Oral administration of ITPP in drinking water increased Hb p50 and maximal exercise capacity (+34 \textpm 10%; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> \&lt; 0.002) in normal and failing mice. Consistent with increased tissue oxygen availability, ITPP decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1upalpha mRNA expression in myocardium. It had no effect on myocardial contractility in isolated mouse cardiac myocytes and did not affect arterial blood pressure in vivo in mice. Thus, ITPP decreases the oxygen binding affinity of Hb, increases tissue oxygen delivery, and increases maximal exercise capacity in normal mice and mice with severe heart failure. ITPP is thus an attractive candidate for the therapy of patients with reduced exercise capacity caused by heart failure. </jats:p>},

abstract = {Obesity is an independent risk factor to develop cardiac functional and structural impairments. Here, we investigated the effects of supplementation of inositols on the electrical, structural, and functional cardiac alterations in the mouse model of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Three groups of C57BL6 mice (n = 16 each) were studied: j) HFD feeding; jj) HFD feeding + inositols from week 9 to 13; jjj) standard diet feeding. Study observation period was 13 weeks. Inositols were administered as mixture of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in the drinking water. Effects of inositols were evaluated based on electrical, structural, and functional cardiac features, autonomic sympatho-vagal balance and arrhythmogenic susceptibility to adrenergic challenge. Heart samples were collected for histological evaluations and transcriptional analyses of genes involved in defining the shape and propagation of the action potential, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Inositol supplementation significantly restored control values of heart rate and QTc interval on ECG and of sympatho-vagal balance. Moreover, it blunted the increase in left ventricular mass and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reversed diastolic dysfunction, reduced the susceptibility to arrhythmic events and restored the expression level of cardiac genes altered by HFD. The present study shows, for the first time, how a short period of supplementation with inositols is able to ameliorate the HFD-induced electrical, structural and functional heart alterations including ventricular remodeling. Results provide a new insight into the cardioprotective effect of inositols, which could pave the way for a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of HFD obesity-induced heart dysfunction.},

abstract = {<jats:p>NaCl stress adversely affects plant growth. Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb (T. ramosissima), a halophyte, thrives in saline-alkali areas. Myo-inositol, a lipid-soluble compound, is crucial for stress response, but its role in mitigating NaCl damage remains underexplored. We analyzed transcriptome sequencing and metabolites in T. ramosissima roots under NaCl stress at various intervals (0 h, 48 h, and 168 h). We identified ten Myo-inositol oxygenase-related genes. Nine of these genes, linked to metabolic pathways involving Myo-inositol, showed differential expression. Myo-inositol accumulation increased over time, suggesting its role as an osmotic regulator and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. This accumulation likely shields T. ramosissima from NaCl-induced osmotic and oxidative damage. Notably, Unigene0002140 and Unigene0095980, associated with Myo-inositol oxygenase, appear to regulate Myo-inositol accumulation and correlate significantly with its levels. We hypothesize they are key genes in controlling Myo-inositol levels, warranting further study. This research illuminates the role of Myo-inositol oxygenase-related genes in T. ramosissima roots combating NaCl stress, offering insights for selecting salt-tolerant tree species.</jats:p>},

abstract = {This study investigates the effects of inositol (INO) supplementation on cardiac changes caused by Li in mice. The study involved 4 groups of C57BL6 mice (n=10 each): (i) mice orally administered with Li2CO3 for 8 weeks, then 4 additional weeks without (Li_group) or (ii) with INO supplementation (Li_INOdelayed_group) (total of 12 weeks); (iii) mice given Li2CO3 and INO supplementation concurrently for 12 weeks (Li+INO_group); (iv) one group left untreated (C-group). The INO was administered as a mixture of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (80:1) in drinking water. The mice were characterised for heart morphology, function, electrical activity, arrhythmogenic susceptibility, and multiorgan histopathology (heart, liver and kidney). Cardiomyocyte size, protein expression of key signalling pathways related to hypertrophy, and transcription levels of ion channel subunits and hypertrophy markers were evaluated in the ventricle tissue. The study found that INO supplementation reduced the Li-induced cardiac adverse effects, including systolic impairment and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. The positive effect on arrhythmias might be attributed to the restored expression levels of the potassium channel subunit Kv 1.5. Additionally, INO improved cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, possibly by inhibiting the Li-induced activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway and by restoring the normal expression level of BNP, and alleviated injury in the liver and kidney. The effect was preventive if INO supplementation was taken concurrently with Li and therapeutic if INO was administered after Li-induced cardiac impairments were established. These results provide new insights into the cardioprotective effect of INO and suggest a potential treatment approach for Li-induced cardiac disease.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean diet has long been recognized as one of the most effective ways to prevent and improve cardiovascular disease. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the typical sources of fat in the Mediterranean diet which have been shown to have noteworthy nutritional value and positive impact on human health. It is worth noting that EVOO owes its superior nutritional value to its bioactive composition. The main component of EVOO is monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in the form of oleic acid. Oleic acid accounts for up to 70 %80 % of EVOO. Secondly, EVOO contains approximately more than 30 phenolic compounds, of which HT is essential for the protection against cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focused on the potential mechanisms of oleic acid and polyphenols combat cardiovascular diseases risk in terms of oxidative stress, inflammation, blood pressure, endothelial function and cholesterol. This review might provide a reference for the studies on cardiovascular protective effects of EVOO.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, driven by complex interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with diet playing a pivotal role. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), is a plant-based fat that has garnered attention for its robust cardiovascular benefits, which are attributed to its unique composition of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid (OA); and bioactive polyphenols, such as Hydroxytyrosol (HT) and oleocanthal. These compounds collectively exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and lipid-modulating effects. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that EVOO's properties reduce major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. EVOO also promotes endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thus favoring vasodilation, lowering blood pressure (BP), and supporting vascular integrity. Furthermore, it modulates biomarkers of cardiovascular health, such as C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and NT-proBNP, aligning with improved hemostatic balance and reduced arterial vulnerability. Emerging evidence highlights its interaction with gut microbiota, further augmenting its cardioprotective effects. This review synthesizes current evidence, elucidating EVOO's multifaceted mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Future directions emphasize the need for advanced extraction techniques, nutraceutical formulations, and personalized dietary recommendations to maximize its health benefits. EVOO represents a valuable addition to dietary strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p>},

These compounds collectively exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and lipid-modulating effects. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that EVOOâs properties reduce major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. EVOO also promotes endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thus favoring vasodilation, lowering blood pressure (BP), and supporting vascular integrity. Furthermore, it modulates biomarkers of cardiovascular health, such as C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and NT-proBNP, aligning with improved hemostatic balance and reduced arterial vulnerability. Emerging evidence highlights its interaction with gut microbiota, further augmenting its cardioprotective effects. This review synthesizes current evidence, elucidating EVOOâs multifaceted mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Future directions emphasize the need for advanced extraction techniques, nutraceutical formulations, and personalized dietary recommendations to maximize its health benefits. EVOO represents a valuable addition to dietary strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p>},
