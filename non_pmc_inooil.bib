Inositol is an essential micronutrient for salmon, carp, tilapia and shrimps, particularly juveniles. In a previous opinion on inositol, the EFSA Panel\NBSPon Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP6) could not conclude on the safety and efficacy of inositol when used in pet food at the recommended use levels of between 500 and 3,000\NBSPmg/kg owing to insufficient evidence. The European Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluate the safety and efficacy of inositol when used as nutritional additive (functional group: vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having a similar effect) in food for dogs and cats. In the present application, the applicant proposed a maximum supplementation level of 1,500\NBSPmg inositol/kg dry complete feed for dogs and cats. The FEEDAP Panel\NBSPconcluded, based on the free inositol concentrations found in commercial diets for pets, that inositol up to a total content of 3,000\NBSPmg free inositol/kg dry complete feed (88\% dry matter) could be considered safe for dogs and cats. Evidence is lacking for any benefit of inositol supplementation of foods for dogs and cats.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Myo-inositol, a carbocyclic sugar, is believed to be relevant to renal pathobiology since the kidney is the major site for its catabolism. Its role in acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been fully investigated. Ferroptosis, a unique form of regulated cell death, is involved in various types of renal injuries. The relevance of myo-inositol with respect to the process of ferroptosis has not been explored either. Herein, our current exploratory studies revealed that supplementation of myo-inositol attenuates cisplatin-induced injury in cultured Boston University mouse proximal tubular (BUMPT) cells and renal tubules in vivo. Moreover, our studies unraveled that metabolic parameters pertaining to ferroptosis were disrupted in cisplatin-treated proximal tubular cells, which were seemingly remedied by the administration of myo-inositol. Mechanistically, we noted that cisplatin treatment led to the up-regulation of NOX4, a key enzyme relevant to ferroptosis, which was normalized by the administration of myo-inositol. Furthermore, we observed that changes in the NOX4 expression induced by cisplatin or myo-inositol were modulated by carboxy-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Taken together, our investigation suggests that myo-inositol promotes CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of NOX4 to decelerate the process of ferroptosis, leading to the amelioration of cisplatin-induced AKI.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Abstract Recent studies have emphasized the role of mitochondria in renal function as well as in renal injury. Poor mitochondrial quality control mechanisms including mitochondrial fusion, fission and mitophagy are major contributors for progression of diabetic renal injury. The current study is aimed to evaluate the protective role of myo-inositol (MI) against diabetic nephropathy (DN) by utilizing high glucose exposed NRK 52E cell and streptozotocin (STZ) induced DN model. MI supplementation (at doses 37.5\NBSPand 75mg/kg) ameliorated albuminuria and enhanced the renal function as indicated significant improvement in urinary creatinine and urea levels. On the other hand, the western blot analysis of both in vitro and in vivo studies has revealed poor mitophagy in renal cells which was reversed upon myo-inositol treatment. Apart from targeting the canonical PINK1/Parkin pathway, we also focused on the role mitophagy receptors prohibitin (PHB) and NIP3-like protein (NIX). A significant reduction in expression of NIX and PHB2 was observed in renal tissue of diabetic control rats and high glucose exposed NRK 52E cells. Myo-inositol treatment resulted in positive modulation of PINK1/Parkin pathway as well as PHB2 and NIX. Myo-inositol also enhanced the mitochondrial biogenesis in renal tissue of diabetic rat by upregulating Nrf2/SIRT1/PGC-1upalpha axis. The current study thus underlines the renoprotective effect myo-inositol, upregulation of mitophagy proteins and mitochondrial biogenesis upon myo-inositol treatment.},

In normal mice, i.p. administration of ITPP (0.5-3 g/kg) caused a dose-related increase in the oxygen tension at which Hb is 50% saturated (p50), with a maximal increase of 31%.

ITPP increased exercise capacity, with a maximal increase of 63 \textpm 7% ( <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.005). Oral administration of ITPP in drinking water increased Hb p50 and maximal exercise capacity (+34 \textpm 10%; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> \&lt; 0.002) in normal and failing mice. Consistent with increased tissue oxygen availability, ITPP decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1upalpha mRNA expression in myocardium. It had no effect on myocardial contractility in isolated mouse cardiac myocytes and did not affect arterial blood pressure in vivo in mice. Thus, ITPP decreases the oxygen binding affinity of Hb, increases tissue oxygen delivery, and increases maximal exercise capacity in normal mice and mice with severe heart failure. ITPP is thus an attractive candidate for the therapy of patients with reduced exercise capacity caused by heart failure. </jats:p>},

abstract = {Obesity is an independent risk factor to develop cardiac functional and structural impairments. Here, we investigated the effects of supplementation of inositols on the electrical, structural, and functional cardiac alterations in the mouse model of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Three groups of C57BL6 mice (n = 16 each) were studied: j) HFD feeding; jj) HFD feeding + inositols from week 9 to 13; jjj) standard diet feeding. Study observation period was 13 weeks. Inositols were administered as mixture of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in the drinking water. Effects of inositols were evaluated based on electrical, structural, and functional cardiac features, autonomic sympatho-vagal balance and arrhythmogenic susceptibility to adrenergic challenge. Heart samples were collected for histological evaluations and transcriptional analyses of genes involved in defining the shape and propagation of the action potential, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Inositol supplementation significantly restored control values of heart rate and QTc interval on ECG and of sympatho-vagal balance. Moreover, it blunted the increase in left ventricular mass and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reversed diastolic dysfunction, reduced the susceptibility to arrhythmic events and restored the expression level of cardiac genes altered by HFD. The present study shows, for the first time, how a short period of supplementation with inositols is able to ameliorate the HFD-induced electrical, structural and functional heart alterations including ventricular remodeling. Results provide a new insight into the cardioprotective effect of inositols, which could pave the way for a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of HFD obesity-induced heart dysfunction.},

abstract = {<jats:p>NaCl stress adversely affects plant growth. Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb (T. ramosissima), a halophyte, thrives in saline-alkali areas. Myo-inositol, a lipid-soluble compound, is crucial for stress response, but its role in mitigating NaCl damage remains underexplored. We analyzed transcriptome sequencing and metabolites in T. ramosissima roots under NaCl stress at various intervals (0 h, 48 h, and 168 h). We identified ten Myo-inositol oxygenase-related genes. Nine of these genes, linked to metabolic pathways involving Myo-inositol, showed differential expression. Myo-inositol accumulation increased over time, suggesting its role as an osmotic regulator and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. This accumulation likely shields T. ramosissima from NaCl-induced osmotic and oxidative damage. Notably, Unigene0002140 and Unigene0095980, associated with Myo-inositol oxygenase, appear to regulate Myo-inositol accumulation and correlate significantly with its levels. We hypothesize they are key genes in controlling Myo-inositol levels, warranting further study. This research illuminates the role of Myo-inositol oxygenase-related genes in T. ramosissima roots combating NaCl stress, offering insights for selecting salt-tolerant tree species.</jats:p>},

abstract = {This study investigates the effects of inositol (INO) supplementation on cardiac changes caused by Li in mice. The study involved 4 groups of C57BL6 mice (n=10 each): (i) mice orally administered with Li2CO3 for 8 weeks, then 4 additional weeks without (Li_group) or (ii) with INO supplementation (Li_INOdelayed_group) (total of 12 weeks); (iii) mice given Li2CO3 and INO supplementation concurrently for 12 weeks (Li+INO_group); (iv) one group left untreated (C-group). The INO was administered as a mixture of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (80:1) in drinking water. The mice were characterised for heart morphology, function, electrical activity, arrhythmogenic susceptibility, and multiorgan histopathology (heart, liver and kidney). Cardiomyocyte size, protein expression of key signalling pathways related to hypertrophy, and transcription levels of ion channel subunits and hypertrophy markers were evaluated in the ventricle tissue. The study found that INO supplementation reduced the Li-induced cardiac adverse effects, including systolic impairment and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. The positive effect on arrhythmias might be attributed to the restored expression levels of the potassium channel subunit Kv 1.5. Additionally, INO improved cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, possibly by inhibiting the Li-induced activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway and by restoring the normal expression level of BNP, and alleviated injury in the liver and kidney. The effect was preventive if INO supplementation was taken concurrently with Li and therapeutic if INO was administered after Li-induced cardiac impairments were established. These results provide new insights into the cardioprotective effect of INO and suggest a potential treatment approach for Li-induced cardiac disease.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean diet has long been recognized as one of the most effective ways to prevent and improve cardiovascular disease. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the typical sources of fat in the Mediterranean diet which have been shown to have noteworthy nutritional value and positive impact on human health. It is worth noting that EVOO owes its superior nutritional value to its bioactive composition. The main component of EVOO is monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in the form of oleic acid. Oleic acid accounts for up to 70 %80 % of EVOO. Secondly, EVOO contains approximately more than 30 phenolic compounds, of which HT is essential for the protection against cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focused on the potential mechanisms of oleic acid and polyphenols combat cardiovascular diseases risk in terms of oxidative stress, inflammation, blood pressure, endothelial function and cholesterol. This review might provide a reference for the studies on cardiovascular protective effects of EVOO.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, driven by complex interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with diet playing a pivotal role. Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), is a plant-based fat that has garnered attention for its robust cardiovascular benefits, which are attributed to its unique composition of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid (OA); and bioactive polyphenols, such as Hydroxytyrosol (HT) and oleocanthal. These compounds collectively exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and lipid-modulating effects. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that EVOO's properties reduce major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. EVOO also promotes endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thus favoring vasodilation, lowering blood pressure (BP), and supporting vascular integrity. Furthermore, it modulates biomarkers of cardiovascular health, such as C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and NT-proBNP, aligning with improved hemostatic balance and reduced arterial vulnerability. Emerging evidence highlights its interaction with gut microbiota, further augmenting its cardioprotective effects. This review synthesizes current evidence, elucidating EVOO's multifaceted mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Future directions emphasize the need for advanced extraction techniques, nutraceutical formulations, and personalized dietary recommendations to maximize its health benefits. EVOO represents a valuable addition to dietary strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p>},

These compounds collectively exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and lipid-modulating effects. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that EVOOâ€™s properties reduce major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. EVOO also promotes endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thus favoring vasodilation, lowering blood pressure (BP), and supporting vascular integrity. Furthermore, it modulates biomarkers of cardiovascular health, such as C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and NT-proBNP, aligning with improved hemostatic balance and reduced arterial vulnerability. Emerging evidence highlights its interaction with gut microbiota, further augmenting its cardioprotective effects. This review synthesizes current evidence, elucidating EVOOâ€™s multifaceted mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Future directions emphasize the need for advanced extraction techniques, nutraceutical formulations, and personalized dietary recommendations to maximize its health benefits. EVOO represents a valuable addition to dietary strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p xml:lang=en>4-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA, para-aminobenzoic acid) exhibits multifaceted therapeutic potential in neuropsychiatric disorders through its roles in neurotransmitter modulation, anti-inflammatory action, and antioxidant defense. Experimental and clinical evidence demonstrates that PABA enhances serotonin and dopamine synthesis by activating key enzymes (e.g., tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase), thereby stabilizing mood and improving cognitive function. Mechanistically, PABA suppresses neuroinflammation by inhibiting NF-upkappaB signaling and cytokine production (e.g., IL-1upbeta, TNF-upalpha) while scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate oxidative stress and protect neuronal integrity. Clinical studies indicate that PABA may synergize with traditional antidepressants by targeting serotonin reuptake transporters (SERT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), offering improved outcomes in major depressive disorder. Despite promising results, further research is needed to optimize dosing regimens, validate long-term safety, and explore pharmacogenomic interactions. Crucially, experimental validation through cellular and animal models is required to substantiate PABA's proposed mechanisms, particularly its regulation of NF-upkappaB signaling and enzyme activity in neurotransmitter synthesis. This review underscores PABA's potential as a neuroprotective agent and calls for integrated strategies to translate mechanistic insights into clinical applications for complex neurological conditions.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) alters the sensitivity of tumor cells to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Materials: Cellular proliferation was assessed by WST-1 assays. The effects of PABA and radiation on tumor growth were examined with chick embryo and murine models. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to quantify p21CIP1 and CDC25A levels. Results: Para-aminobenzoic acid enhanced (by 50%) the growth inhibitory activity of radiation on B16F10 cells, whereas it had no effect on melanocytes. Para-aminobenzoic acid enhanced (50-80%) the antitumor activity of radiation on B16F10 and 4T1 tumors in vivo. The combination of PABA and radiation therapy increased tumor apoptosis. Treatment of tumor cells with PABA increased expression of CDC25A and decreased levels of p21CIP1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PABA might represent a compound capable of enhancing the antitumor activity of ionizing radiation by a mechanism involving altered expression of proteins known to regulate cell cycle arrest.},

These drugs have been found to induce the formation of an enlarged hyperplasti thyroid gland in the mammal, bird, amphibian and fish.This state is associated with a condition of functional hypothyroidism due to the interference by the drugs with the production of normal thyroid principle. Recently it has been reported that rats treated with these drugs display an increased resistance to lowered barometric pressures (Gordon, Goldsmith and Charipper, 1944a; Leblond, 1944; Hughes and Astwood, 1944) which results, at least partly, from the ability of these agents to interferewith thyroid function.The aminobenzoic acids also have been found to produce a goitrogenic effect in rats (the Mackenzies, 1943). This is of considerable interest since para aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a naturally occurring food factor, is the most effective of the three (Astwood, 1943.},

abstract = {Summary A decreased level of thyroid activity, induced by thyroidectomy, thiouracil or p-aminobenzoic acid feeding, prevents or retards the development of hepatic necrosis or fibrosis associated with choline and cystine deficiencies. Although thyroid feeding hastened the death of choline-deficient rats, their livers contained little fat and showed no necrosis or fibrosis. Thyroid feeding hastened the death of cystine-deficient rats; their livers exhibited the acute necrosis characteristic of this deficiency. Rats living on a commercial chow were more resistant to the toxic effects of hyperthyroidism than animals on our best synthetic ration. The further addition of choline or methionine to this synthetic diet somewhat increased the susceptibility of rats to thyroid toxicity. Animals on low protein diets were more susceptible to thyroid toxicity than those on high protein diets, and animals on high fat diets were somewhat more resistant than those on low fat diets. Animals deficient in both cystine and choline were more susceptible to hyperthyroidism than any other group studied. The existence of an already established fatty liver appeared to protect the rat against thyrotoxicosis. The inclusion of sulfasuxidine, taurine or inositol in a choline-deficient diet prevented the development of cirrhosis during the experimental period but not by virtue of lipotropic action or antithyroid activity, as judged by liver fat content and the histological appearance of the thyroid.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Researchers' interest in silicon as an element important for the functioning of the animal and human body began in the 1970s. Soluble compounds of silicon bioavailable from water and food seem to have important meaning for life processes occurring in the body. So far, researchers have focused on the significance of silicon for the development of bones and connective tissue, and its role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. Despite numerous studies, the role of silicon as an active element in the human body is poorly understood. Since the involvement of lipid oxidation and inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is well known, this article summarizes and discusses the current research and scientific observations regarding silicon, primarily in terms of its beneficial influence on redox and anti-inflammatory reactions and the lipid profile. The association of silicon with the stabilization of the structure of glycosaminoglycans and their protein complexes may also support the anti-atherosclerotic effect. The authors attempted to collect and present existing publications that could confirm the beneficial role of dietary silicon in the prevention of age-related diseases and explain the potential mechanisms of its action.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Phosphoinositides are a minor group of membrane-associated phospholipids that are transiently generated on the cytoplasmic leaflet of many organelle membranes and the plasma membrane. There are seven functionally distinct phosphoinositides, each derived via the reversible phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in various combinations on the inositol ring. Their generation and termination is tightly regulated by phosphatidylinositol-kinases and -phosphatases. These enzymes can function together in an integrated and coordinated manner, whereby the phosphoinositide product of one enzyme may subsequently serve as a substrate for another to generate a different phosphoinositide species. This regulatory mechanism not only enables the transient generation of phosphoinositides on membranes, but also more complex sequential or bidirectional conversion pathways, and phosphoinositides can also be transferred between organelles via membrane contacts. It is this capacity to fine-tune phosphoinositide signals that makes them ideal regulators of membrane organization and dynamics, through their recruitment of signalling, membrane altering and lipid transfer proteins. Research spanning several decades has provided extensive evidence that phosphoinositides are major gatekeepers of membrane organization, with roles in endocytosis, exocytosis, autophagy, lysosome dynamics, vesicular transport and secretion, cilia, inter-organelle membrane contact, endosome maturation and nuclear function. By contrast, there has been remarkably little known about the role of phosphoinositides at mitochondria - an enigmatic and major knowledge gap, with challenges in reliably detecting phosphoinositides at this site. Here we review recent significant breakthroughs in understanding the role of phosphoinositides in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic function.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Inositol may have insulin sensitizing effects; however, its efficacy in the management of PCOS remains indeterminate.To inform the 2023 international evidence-based guidelines in PCOS, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of inositol, alone or in combination with other therapies, in the management of PCOS.Medline, PsycInfo, EMBASE, All EBM, and CINAHL from inception until August 2022.Thirty trials (n = 2230; 1093 intervention, 1137 control), with 19 pooled in meta-analyses were included.Data were extracted for hormonal, metabolic, lipids, psychological, anthropometric, reproductive outcomes, and adverse effects by 1 reviewer, independently verified by a second.Thirteen comparisons were assessed, with 3 in meta-analyses. Evidence suggests benefits for myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol (DCI) for some metabolic measures and potential benefits from DCI for ovulation, but inositol may have no effect on other outcomes. Metformin may improve waist-hip ratio and hirsutism compared to inositol, but there is likely no difference for reproductive outcomes, and the evidence is very uncertain for body mass indexI. Myo-inositol likely causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events compared with metformin; however, these are typically mild and self-limited.The evidence supporting the use of inositol in the management of PCOS is limited and inconclusive. Clinicians and their patients should consider the uncertainty of the evidence together with individual values and preferences when engaging in shared decision-making regarding the use of inositol for PCOS.},

This paper explores the spectrum of observational studies to preclinical investigations and ultimately converges toward potential translational insights derived from animal experimentation. This review highlights the potential and underutilization of zebrafish as an experimental model in this domain. We highlighted the genetic proximity of zebrafish to humans, offering a unique opportunity for translational insights into the health benefits of olive oil and wine. Indeed, we wanted to focus on the potential of zebrafish to elucidate the health benefits of olive oil and wine while calling for continued exploration to unlock its full potential to advance our knowledge of age-related disease prevention within the Mediterranean diet framework.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Mice reared on a purified, semi-synthetic diet without added p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) were only slightly susceptible, if at all, to blood-induced Plasmodium berghei infection. The mouse does not appear to require a dietary source of PABA since growth rate was unaffected by omission of this factor and no deficiency symptoms were detected. The oral administration of PABA at the time of infection to mice fed a PABA-deficient diet restored full susceptibility to infection and promoted normal development of the parasite; at least 1.0 mg PABA/mouse was required to support maximum development of parasitemia. While PABA was completely effective in promoting the development of P. berghei in mice fed a folic acid-deficient diet, folic acid only partially substituted for PABA in mice fed a PABA-deficient diet. Although P. berghei was susceptible to inhibition by folic acid antagonists (aminopterin, pyrimethamine), mice reared on a folic acid-deficient diet containing added PABA developed a higher degree of parasitemia than controls supplemented with folic acid. A pyrimethamine-resistant strain of P. berghei was found to have a greater requirement for PABA than a normal strain for development in the mouse.},

We were the first to establish that PABA is an inducer of endogenous interferon and immunomodulator and displays a virucidal, synergistic antiviral effect when combined with chemical drugs and the properties of a direct anticoagulant. Based on these properties, we elaborated a new medicinal drug ``Actipol'' which was introduced in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Silicon performs an important role in connective tissue, especially in bone and cartilage Silicon's primary effect in bone and cartilage appears to be on formation of the organic matrix. Bone and cartilage abnormalities are associated with a reduction in matrix components, resulting in the establishment of a requirement for silicon in collagen and glycosaminoglycan formation. Additional support for silicon's metabolic role in connective tissue is provided by the finding that silicon is a major ion of osteogenic cells, especially high in the metabolically active state of the cell. Further studies also indicate that silicon participates in the biochemistry of subcellular enzyme-containing structures. Silicon also forms important relationships with other elements. Although it is clear from the body of recent work that silicon performs a specific metabolic function, a structural role has been proposed for silicon in connective tissue. A relationship established between silicon and aging probably relates to glycosaminoglycan changes.},

abstract = {Bone matrix is predominantly made up of collagen, and in vitro and in animal models studies have shown that silicon is linked to glycosaminoglycans and plays an important role in the formation of cross-links between collagen and proteoglycans, determining the beneficial effects on strength, composition, and mechanical properties of bone. However, there are still no precise indications regarding a possible role of silicon on bone health in humans. Given this background, the aim of this narrative review was to consider the effectiveness of silicon dietary intake and silicon dietary supplementation (alone or with other micronutrients), in order to suggest a daily dosage of Si supplementation, on bone mineral density in humans. This review included eight eligible studies: four regarding dietary intake and four considering supplementation with silicon alone or with other nutrients. Despite the number of studies considered being low, the number of subjects studied is high (10012) and the results are interesting. Although to date the available scientific evidences are not considered valid enough to allow to establish an adequate level of Silicon intake, based on extrapolations from the data obtained with studies on animal and human models, it has been suggested that an adequate intake in order to promote beneficial effects for bone could be considered to be around 25 mg silicon/day. As for silicon dietary supplements, it has been shown that the combined treatment with orthosilicic acid (6 mg), calcium, and vitamin D has a potentially beneficial effect on femoral BMD compared to only use of calcium and vitamin D.},

abstract = {Convincing evidence that silicon is a bioactive beneficial trace element continues to accumulate. The evidence, which has come from human, animal, and in vitro studies performed by several laboratories, indicate that silicon in nutritional and supra nutritional amounts promotes bone and connective tissue health, may have a modulating effect on the immune or inflammatory response, and has been associated with mental health. A plausible mechanism of action for the beneficial effects of silicon is the binding of hydroxyl groups of polyols such that it influences the formation and/or utilization of glycosaminoglycans, mucopolysaccharides, and collagen in connective tissue and bone. In addition, silicon may affect the absorption, retention or action of other mineral elements (e.g., aluminum, copper, magnesium). Based on findings from both animal and human experiments, an intake of silicon of near 25mg/d would be a reasonable suggestion for an adequate intake that would assure its nutritional benefits. Increased intakes of silicon through consuming unrefined grains, certain vegetables, and beverages and cereals made from grains should be recognized as a reasonable dietary recommendation.},

abstract = {Physicians are aware of the benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. However, additional nutritional components may also be important for bone health. There is a growing body of the scientific literature which recognizes that silicon plays an essential role in bone formation and maintenance. Silicon improves bone matrix quality and facilitates bone mineralization. Increased intake of bioavailable silicon has been associated with increased bone mineral density. Silicon supplementation in animals and humans has been shown to increase bone mineral density and improve bone strength. Dietary sources of bioavailable silicon include whole grains, cereals, beer, and some vegetables such as green beans. Silicon in the form of silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), is a common food additive but has limited intestinal absorption. More attention to this important mineral by the academic community may lead to improved nutrition, dietary supplements, and better understanding of the role of silicon in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

abstract = {The dissolution of quartz in dilute aqueous solutions of organic acids at 25\textdegree and standard pressure was investigated by the batch dissolution method. The bulk dissolution rate of quartz in 20 mmole/Kg citrate solutions at pH 7 was 8 to 10 times faster than that in pure water. After 1750 hours the concentration of dissolved silica in the citrate solution was 167 upmumole/Kg compared to 50 upmumole/Kg in water and a 20 mmole/Kg solution of acetate at pH 7. Solutions of salicylic, oxalic, and humic acids also accelerated the dissolution of quartz in aqueous solution at pH 7. The rate of dissolution in organic acids decreased sharply with decreasing pH. The possibility of a silica-organic acid complex was investigated using UV-difference spectroscopy. Results suggest that dissolved silica is complexed by citrate, oxalate and pyruvate at pH 7 by an electron-donor acceptor complex, whereas no complexation occurs between silica and acetate, lactate, malonate, or succinate. Three models are proposed for the solution and surface complexation of silica by organic acid anions which result in the accelerated dissolution and increased solubility of quartz in organic rich water.},

abstract = {Silicate calculi are common in some mammals, such as dogs and sheep, but extremely rare in humans. We report a case of silicate calculi in a woman using oral over-the-counter Uncaria tomentosa, Digestive Advantage and FlexProtex supplements. All 3 contained the excipient silica dioxide. Stone analysis showed composition of 100% silicate. The nephrolithiasis promptly abated after discontinuation of the products containing silica, then returned when the patient restarted her supplements. This case emphasizes the importance of stone analysis when obvious causes of nephrolithiasis are unclear and highlights the concerns of using over-the-counter supplements without substantial oversight.},

abstract = {Oleic acid (OA), a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), has previously been shown to reverse saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance (IR). However, its underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In addition, previous studies have shown that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a upomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), reverses PA-induced muscle IR, but whether EPA plays the same role in hepatic IR and its possible mechanism involved need to be further clarified. Here, we confirmed that EPA reversed PA-induced IR in HepG2 cells and compared the proteomic changes in HepG2 cells after treatment with different free fatty acids (FFAs). A total of 234 proteins were determined to be differentially expressed after PA+OA treatment. Their functions were mainly related to responses to stress and endogenous stimuli, lipid metabolic process, and protein binding. For PA+EPA treatment, the PA-induced expression changes of 1326 proteins could be reversed by EPA, 415 of which were mitochondrial proteins, with most of the functional proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mechanistic studies revealed that the protein encoded by JUN and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in OA- and EPA-reversed PA-induced IR, respectively. EPA and OA alleviated PA-induced abnormal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, ROS generation, and calcium (Ca2+) content. Importantly, H2O2-activated production of ROS increased the protein expression of JUN, further resulting in IR in HepG2 cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that ROS/JUN is a common response pathway employed by HepG2 cells toward FFA-regulated IR.},

Taken together, we demonstrate that ROS/JUN is a common response pathway employed by HepG2 cells toward FFA-regulated IR.},

abstract = {Abstract The brain utilizes glucose as a primary energy substrate but also fatty acids for the upbeta-oxidation in mitochondria. The upbeta-oxidation is reported to occur mainly in astrocytes, but its capacity and efficacy against different fatty acids remain unknown. Here, we show the fatty acid preference for the upbeta-oxidation in mitochondria of murine cultured astrocytes. Fatty acid oxidation assay using an extracellular flux analyzer showed that saturated or monosaturated fatty acids, palmitic acid and oleic acid, are preferred substrates over polyunsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. We also report that fatty acid binding proteins expressed in the astrocytes contribute less to fatty acid transport to mitochondria for upbeta-oxidation. Our results could give insight into understanding energy metabolism through fatty acid consumption in the brain.},
