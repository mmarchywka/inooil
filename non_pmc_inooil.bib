Inositol is an essential micronutrient for salmon, carp, tilapia and shrimps, particularly juveniles. In a previous opinion on inositol, the EFSA Panel\NBSPon Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP6) could not conclude on the safety and efficacy of inositol when used in pet food at the recommended use levels of between 500 and 3,000\NBSPmg/kg owing to insufficient evidence. The European Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluate the safety and efficacy of inositol when used as nutritional additive (functional group: vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having a similar effect) in food for dogs and cats. In the present application, the applicant proposed a maximum supplementation level of 1,500\NBSPmg inositol/kg dry complete feed for dogs and cats. The FEEDAP Panel\NBSPconcluded, based on the free inositol concentrations found in commercial diets for pets, that inositol up to a total content of 3,000\NBSPmg free inositol/kg dry complete feed (88\% dry matter) could be considered safe for dogs and cats. Evidence is lacking for any benefit of inositol supplementation of foods for dogs and cats.},
